## Code Style

Before contributing a pull request, we highly suggest applying a code formatter to the written code.

We have provided at profile for java located in [Codestyle File ./docs/CodeStyle.eclipse.xml](dev/docs/CodeStyle_eclipse.xml). This can be loaded in most editors e.g.:

- [Eclipse](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10432538/eclipse-import-conf-xml-files#10433986)
- [IntelliJ](https://imagej.net/Eclipse_code_style_profiles_and_IntelliJ)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46030629/need-to-import-eclipse-java-formatter-profile-in-visual-studio-code)

## License

Each file in the project has a header license, when adding files remember to add an appropriate comment for that filetype containing the license. One Example is this file: [RAW Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/systemml/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). The specific type of commenting `\** *\` or `# ...` varies depending on filetype, but the content is the same.
