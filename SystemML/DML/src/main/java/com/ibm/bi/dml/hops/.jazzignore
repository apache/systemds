### Jazz Ignore 0
# The property core.ignore specifies a list of file patterns that will be
# ignored in this directory. 
#
# The value of core.ignore.recursive will be ignored.
#
# Ignored files and folders will not be committed, but may be modified during
# accept or update.
# Ignore properties should contain a space separated list of filename patterns.
# Each pattern is case sensitive and surrounded by braces ('{' and '}'). 
# "*" matches zero or more characters, and "?" matches single characters. 
#
#   e.g: {*.sh} {\.*}    ignores shell scripts and hidden files

# NOTE: modifying ignore files will not change the ignore status of derived 
# resources.
