Algorithms
==========

SystemDS support different Machine learning algorithms out of the box.

As an example the lm algorithm can be used as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  # Import numpy and SystemDS
  import numpy as np
  from systemds.context import SystemDSContext
  from systemds.operator.algorithm import lm

  # Set a seed
  np.random.seed(0)
  # Generate matrix of feature vectors
  features = np.random.rand(10, 15)
  # Generate a 1-column matrix of response values
  y = np.random.rand(10, 1)

  # compute the weights
  with SystemDSContext() as sds:
    weights = lm(sds.from_numpy(features), sds.from_numpy(y)).compute()
    print(weights)

The output should be similar to

.. code-block:: python
