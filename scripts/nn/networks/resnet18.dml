     * Forward pass of the ResNet 18 model as introduced in
     * "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by
     * Kaiming He et. al. and inspired by PyTorch.
     *
     * Inputs:
     * - X: Inputs, of shape (N, C_in*Hin*Win).
     *     C_in = 3 is expected.
     * - Hin: Input height.
     * - Win: Input width.
     * - model: Weights and bias matrices of the model
     *     with the following order/content:
     *   -> 1: Weights of conv 1 7x7, of shape (64, 3*7*7)
     *   -> 2: Weights of batch norm 1, of shape (64, 1).
     *   -> 3: Bias of batch norm 1, of shape (64, 1).
     *   -> 4: List of weights for first residual layer
     *         with 64 base channels.
     *   -> 5: List of weights for second residual layer
     *         with 128 base channels.

     *         with 256 base channels.
     *   -> 7: List of weights for fourth residual layer
     *         with 512 base channels.
     *      List of residual layers 1, 2, 3 & 4 have
     *      the content/order:
     *      -> 1: List of weights for first residual
     *            block.
     *      -> 2: List of weights for second residual
     *            block.
     *         Each list of weights for a residual block
     *         must follow the same order as defined in
     *         the documentation of basic_block_forward().
     *   -> 8: Weights of fully connected layer, of shape (512, 1000)
     *   -> 9: Bias of fully connected layer, of shape (1, 1000)
     * - mode: 'train' or 'test' to indicate if the model is currently
     *     being trained or tested for badge normalization layers.
     *     See badge_norm2d.dml docs for more info.
     * - ema_means_vars: List of exponential moving averages for mean
     *     and variance for badge normalization layers.
     *   -> 1: EMA for mean of badge norm 1, of shape (64, 1).
     *   -> 2: EMA for variance of badge norm 1, of shape (64, 1).
     *   -> 3: List of EMA means and vars for residual layer 1.
     *   -> 4: List of EMA means and vars for residual layer 2.
     *   -> 5: List of EMA means and vars for residual layer 3.
     *   -> 6: List of EMA means and vars for residual layer 4.
     *      Lists for EMAs of layer 1, 2, 3 & 4 must have the
     *      following order:
     *      -> 1: List of EMA means and vars for residual block 1.
     *      -> 2: List of EMA means and vars for residual block 2.
     *         Each list of EMAs for a residual block
     *         must follow the same order as defined in
     *         the documentation of basic_block_forward().
     * - NOTICE: The lists of the first blocks for layer 2, 3 and 4
     *           must include weights and EMAs for 1 extra conv layer
     *           and a batch norm layer for the downsampling on the
     *           identity path.
     *
     * Outputs:
     * - out: Outputs, of shape (N, 1000)
     * - ema_means_vars_upd: List of updated exponential moving averages
     *     for mean and variance of badge normalization layers. It follows
     *     the same exact structure as the input EMAs list.
