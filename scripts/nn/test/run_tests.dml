# Example model
# NOTE: This could result in a false-negative in which the test fails
# due to a kink being crossed in the ReLU nonlinearity.  This occurs
# when the tests, f(x-h) and f(x+h), end up on opposite sides of the
# zero threshold of max(0, fx).  Although we have stabilized it, we
# will still remove it here to avoid false failures during automated
# testing. In the future, we can explicitly check for this scenario
# and rerun the test automatically.  For manual testing, simply
# rerun the tests.
