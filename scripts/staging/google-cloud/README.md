## Create a dataproc cluster

Create a cluster name
```sh
CLUSTERNAME=dp-systemds
```

Set Dataproc cluster region
```sh
gcloud config set dataproc/region us-central1
```

Now, create a new cluster

[`gcloud dataproc clusters create` reference](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/dataproc/clusters/create)
```sh
gcloud dataproc clusters create ${CLUSTERNAME} \
  --scopes=cloud-platform \
  --tags systemds \
  --zone=us-central1-c \
  --worker-machine-type n1-standard-2 \
  --worker-boot-disk-size 500 \
  --master-machine-type n1-standard-2 \
  --master-boot-disk-size 500 \
  --image-version 2.0
```

## Submit a Spark job to the cluster

Jobs can be submitted via a Cloud Dataproc API
[`jobs.submit`](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.regions.jobs/submit) request

Submit an example job using `gcloud` tool from the Cloud Shell command line

```sh
gcloud dataproc jobs submit spark --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
  --jars file:///usr/lib/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples.jar -- 1000
```


### Job info and connect

List all the jobs:

```sh
gcloud dataproc jobs list --cluster ${CLUSTERNAME}
```

To get output of a specific job note `jobID` and in the below command
replace `jobID`.

```sh
gcloud dataproc jobs wait jobID
```

### Resizing the cluster

For intensive computations, to add more nodes to the cluster either to speed up.

Existing cluster configuration

```sh
gcloud dataproc clusters describe ${CLUSTERNAME}
```

Add preemptible nodes to increase cluster size:

```sh
gcloud dataproc clusters update ${CLUSTERNAME} --num-preemptible-workers=1
```

Note: `workerConfig` and `secondaryWorkerConfig` will be present.

### SSH into the cluster

SSH into the cluster (primary node) would provide fine grained control of the cluster.

```sh
gcloud compute ssh ${CLUSTERNAME}-m --zone=us-central1-c
```

Note: For the first time, we run `ssh` command on Cloud Shell, it will generate SSH keys
for your account.

The `--scopes=cloud-platform` would allow us to run gcloud inside the cluster too.
For example,

```sh
gcloud dataproc clusters list --region=us-central1
```

to exit the cluster primary instance

```sh
logout
```

### Tags

A `--tags` option allows us to add a tag to each node in the cluster. Firewall rules
can be applied to each node with conditionally adding flags.
