# available sources:
#   - toy: Built-in 10 samples (people/places/products) - clean ground truth
#   - json_struct: HuggingFace MasterControlAIML/JSON-Unstructured-Structured
#   - ner: CoNLL-2003 NER dataset (named entity extraction)
#
# note: The toy dataset uses STRICT accuracy checking (90% exact match required)
# to better differentiate model quality. OpenAI typically scores 90%, local
# models 60-80%. For harder evaluation, use "ner" or "json_struct".
