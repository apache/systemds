From ReadMe.md:
To run our queries, we can execute the following shell script `run_script.sh`  (in ssb directory). It has the three following parameter flags.
1. `q`: (QUERY_NAME) Name of the query to be executed.
    - **all**: executes all queries
    - **[QUERY_NAME]** like q1_1 or q1.1: Executes the selected query like q1_1. dml. Both formats q1_1 or q1.1 are allowed. It will be automatically translated.
    - Currently the following queries are avalaible {"q1_1", "q1_2", "q1_3", "q2_1", "q2_2", "q2_3", "q3_1", "q3_2","q3_3", "q3_4", "q4_1", "q4_2", "q4_3"}
2. `s`: (SCALE) The numerical scale factor like 0.01 or 1 etc.
    - Be careful: Please do not experiment with large scale factor over 0.2 in SystemDS. Its join operation is currently very slow.
3. `d`: (DB_SYSTEM) Name of the database system used.
    - **all**: executes all queries
    - **systemds**: SystemDS executes DML scripts.
    - **postgres**: PostgreSQL executes SQL queries.
    - ( **duckdb**: DuckDB executes SQL queries.) 
  
The command line could look like this:
```
$ ./run_script.sh -q [YOUR_QUERY_NAME] -s [YOUR_SCALE] -d [YOUR_DB_SYSTEM]
```
Examples
```
$ ./run_script.sh -q all -s 0.1 -d all
$ ./run_script.sh -q q4_3 -s 0.1 -d systemds
$ ./run_script.sh -q all -s 0.1 -d postgres
```
If an option not specified by user, the default values are as follows:
```
QUERY_NAME="q2_1"
SCALE=0.1
DB_SYSTEM="systemds"
```
