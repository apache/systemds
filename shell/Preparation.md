**Meeting Date**: Monday at 2pm
**Project**: SystemDS Star Schema Benchmark (SSB) Implementation
**Branch**: feature/ssb-benchmark
**Preparation Date**: August 30, 2025

---

## **Key Areas to Understand and Refresh Before Your Meeting**

### **1. ðŸŽ¯ Project Scope & Accomplishments (Your Main Talking Points)**

**What You've Built:**
- **Complete SSB benchmark implementation** for SystemDS with 13 DML queries (Q1.1-Q4.3)
- **Two production-ready shell scripts** with sophisticated features
- **Multi-engine performance comparison** (SystemDS vs PostgreSQL vs DuckDB)
- **Statistical analysis infrastructure** with warmup runs and reliability metrics

**Key Numbers to Know:**
- **13 SSB queries** implemented across 4 flights
- **Performance results show**: PostgreSQL/DuckDB often outperform SystemDS (20-30ms vs 1800-3200ms)
- **Data scale**: 30K customers, 200K parts, 2K suppliers, 2.5K dates (lineorder size not captured in metadata)
- **System specs**: Apple M1 Pro, 16GB RAM, SystemDS 3.4.0-SNAPSHOT

### **2. ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis Deep Dive**

**Current Performance Patterns (Be Ready to Discuss):**
- **SystemDS Shell timing**: 1800-3200ms (includes JVM startup overhead)
- **SystemDS Core timing**: 800-2200ms (pure computation time)
- **PostgreSQL**: 20-50ms (highly optimized for these workloads)
- **DuckDB**: 24-30ms (analytical engine, very fast)

**Why SystemDS is Slower (Prepare to Explain):**
- **JVM startup overhead**: Cold start penalty for each query
- **Matrix operations**: SystemDS converts to matrices, not optimized for pure SQL-style aggregations
- **Single-threaded constraint**: Fair comparison, but PostgreSQL/DuckDB are more optimized for this
- **Data loading**: Reading CSV files repeatedly vs in-memory optimized storage

### **3. ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details**

**SystemDS-Specific Approach:**
```dml
# Using relational algebra functions
source("./scripts/builtin/raSelection.dml") as raSel
source("./scripts/builtin/raJoin.dml") as raJoin

# Data extraction and filtering
d_year_filt = raSel::m_raSelection(date_matrix_min, col=2, op="==", val=1993);
joined_matrix = raJoin::m_raJoin(A=lo_quan_disc_filt, colA=1, B=d_year_filt, colB=1, method="sort-merge");
```

**Key Technical Decisions You Made:**
- **Relational algebra approach**: Using built-in RA functions instead of pure matrix operations
- **Data minimization**: Extract only needed columns to optimize runtime
- **Fair comparison**: Single-threaded execution across all engines
- **Statistical rigor**: Multiple runs with warmup for reliable measurements

### **4. ðŸ§© Star Schema Benchmark Understanding**

**Query Flight Categories (Know These Well):**
- **Flight 1 (Q1.*)**: Basic aggregation, single dimension filters
- **Flight 2 (Q2.*)**: Product analysis with supplier regions
- **Flight 3 (Q3.*)**: Customer/supplier geographic analysis
- **Flight 4 (Q4.*)**: Complex profitability analysis with multiple dimensions

**Sample Query Results You Can Reference:**
- **Q1.1**: Revenue = 687,752,409 (simple aggregation)
- **Q2.1**: 53 rows of results (brand/region analysis)
- **Q4.1**: Year/country profitability analysis

### **5. ðŸ’¡ Key Insights & Observations**

**What Your Data Shows:**
1. **PostgreSQL/DuckDB excel** at traditional OLAP workloads
2. **SystemDS has overhead** but provides ML/matrix capabilities
3. **Query complexity varies**: Q1 simple aggregation vs Q4 complex multi-dimensional
4. **Scalability question**: How would this change with larger datasets?

**Technical Architecture Benefits:**
- **Reproducible benchmarking**: Seed-based runs, metadata capture
- **Multi-format output**: Human-readable, CSV for analysis, JSON for automation
- **Comprehensive tooling**: Progress tracking, error handling, environment validation

### **6. ðŸ¤” Questions Your Mentor Might Ask (Be Prepared For)**

**Research Questions:**
- "What insights does this provide about SystemDS's position in the analytics landscape?"
- "How would this extend to ML workloads where SystemDS excels?"
