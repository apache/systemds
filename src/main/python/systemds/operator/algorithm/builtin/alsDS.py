     Alternating-Least-Squares (ALS) algorithm using a direct solve method for
     individual least squares problems (reg="L2"). This script computes an 
     approximate factorization of a low-rank matrix V into two matrices L and R.
     Matrices L and R are computed by minimizing a loss function (with regularization).

    :param check: Check for convergence after every iteration, i.e., updating L and R once
    :param threshold: Assuming check is set to TRUE, the algorithm stops and convergence is declared
        if the decrease in loss in any two consecutive iterations falls below this threshold;
        if check is FALSE threshold is ignored
