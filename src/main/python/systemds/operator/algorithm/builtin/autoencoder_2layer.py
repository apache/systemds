     Trains a 2-layer autoencoder with minibatch SGD and step-size decay.
     If invoked with H1 > H2 then it becomes a 'bowtie' structured autoencoder
     Weights are initialized using Glorot & Bengio (2010) AISTATS initialization.
     The script standardizes the input before training (can be turned off).
     Also, it randomly reshuffles rows before training.
     Currently, tanh is set to be the activation function. 
     By re-implementing 'func' DML-bodied function, one can change the activation.
