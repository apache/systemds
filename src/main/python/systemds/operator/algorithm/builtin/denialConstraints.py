     Example: explanation of constraint 2 --> it can't happen that one professor of rank Prof has more years of service than other, but lower salary.
    
    
    
    :param dataFrame: frame which columns represent the variables of the data and the rows correspond
        to different tuples or instances.
        Recommended to have a column indexing the instances from 1 to N (N=number of instances).
    :param constraintsFrame: frame with fixed columns and each row representing one constraint.
        1. idx: (double) index of the constraint, from 1 to M (number of constraints)
        2. constraint.type: (string) The constraints can be of 3 different kinds:
        - variableCompare: for each instance, it will compare the values of two variables (with a relation <, > or =).
        - valueCompare: for each instance, it will compare a fixed value and a variable value (with a relation <, > or =).
        - instanceCompare: for every couple of instances, it will compare the relation between two variables,
        ie  if the value of the variable 1 in instance 1 is lower/higher than the value of variable 1 in instance 2,
        then the value of of variable 2 in instance 2 can't be lower/higher than the value of variable 2 in instance 2.
        3. group.by: (boolean) if TRUE only one group of data (defined by a variable option) will be considered for the constraint.
        4. group.variable: (string, only if group.by TRUE) name of the variable (column in dataFrame) that will divide our data in groups.
        5. group.option: (only if group.by TRUE) option of the group.variable that defines the group to consider.
        6. variable1: (string) first variable to compare (name of column in dataFrame).
        7. relation: (string) can be < , > or = in the case of variableCompare and valueCompare, and < >, < < , > < or > >
        in the case of instanceCompare
        8. variable2: (string) second variable to compare (name of column in dataFrame) or fixed value for the case of valueCompare.
    :return: Matrix of 2 columns.
        - First column shows the indexes of dataFrame that are wrong.
        - Second column shows the index of the denial constraint that is fulfilled
        If there are no wrong instances to show (0 constrains fulfilled) --> WrongInstances=matrix(0,1,2)
