     This builtin function trains simple feed-forward neural network. The architecture of the
     networks is: affine1 -> relu -> dropout -> affine2 -> configurable output activation function.
     Hidden layer has 128 neurons. Dropout rate is 0.35. Input and output sizes are inferred from X and Y.
