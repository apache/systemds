       CSV format: NAME,[COLUMN],[SCALED],VALUE

       NAME   is the string identifier for the statistic, see the table below.
       COLUMN is an optional integer value that specifies the Y-column for per-column statistics;
              note that a Binomial/Multinomial one-column Y input is converted into multi-column.
       SCALED is an optional Boolean value (TRUE or FALSE) that tells us whether or not the input
                dispersion parameter (disp) scaling has been applied to this statistic.
       VALUE  is the value of the statistic.
