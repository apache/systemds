     The hyperband-function is used for hyper parameter optimization and is based on multi-armed bandits and early
     elimination. Through multiple parallel brackets and consecutive trials it will return the hyper parameter combination
     which performed best on a validation dataset. A set of hyper parameter combinations is drawn from uniform distributions
     with given ranges; Those make up the candidates for hyperband. Notes:
     hyperband is hard-coded for lmCG, and uses lmPredict for validation
     hyperband is hard-coded to use the number of iterations as a resource
     hyperband can only optimize continuous hyperparameters

    :param Ytest: Labels for validation vectors
    :param params: List of parameters to optimize
    :param paramRanges: The min and max values for the uniform distributions to draw from.
        One row per hyper parameter, first column specifies min, second column max value.
    :param R: Controls number of candidates evaluated
    :param eta: Determines fraction of candidates to keep after each trial
