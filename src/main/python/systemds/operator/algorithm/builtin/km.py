     Builtin function that implements the analysis of survival data with KAPLAN-MEIER estimates
    
    
    
    :param X: Input matrix X containing the survival data:
        timestamps, whether event occurred (1) or data is censored (0), and a
        number of factors (categorical features) for grouping and/or stratifying
    :param TE: Column indices of X which contain timestamps (first entry) and event
        information (second entry)
    :param GI: Column indices of X corresponding to the factors to be used for grouping
    :param SI: Column indices of X corresponding to the factors to be used for stratifying
    :param alpha: Parameter to compute 100*(1-alpha)% confidence intervals for the survivor
        function and its median
    :param err: "greenwood" Parameter to specify the error type according to "greenwood" (the default) or "peto"
    :param conf: Parameter to modify the confidence interval; "plain" keeps the lower and
        upper bound of the confidence interval unmodified, "log" (the default)
        corresponds to logistic transformation and "log-log" corresponds to the
        complementary log-log transformation
    :param test: If survival data for multiple groups is available specifies which test to
        perform for comparing survival data across multiple groups: "none" (the default)
        "log-rank" or "wilcoxon" test
    :return: Matrix KM whose dimension depends on the number of groups (denoted by g) and
        strata (denoted by s) in the data:
        each collection of 7 consecutive columns in KM corresponds to a unique
        combination of groups and strata in the data with the following schema
        1. col: timestamp
        2. col: no. at risk
        3. col: no. of events
        4. col: Kaplan-Meier estimate of survivor function surv

    :return: Matrix M whose dimension depends on the number of groups (g) and strata (s) in
        the data (k denotes the number of factors used for grouping  ,i.e., ncol(GI) and
        l denotes the number of factors used for stratifying, i.e., ncol(SI))
        M[,1:k]: unique combination of values in the k factors used for grouping
        M[,(k+1):(k+l)]: unique combination of values in the l factors used for stratifying
        M[,k+l+1]: total number of records
        M[,k+l+2]: total number of events
        M[,k+l+3]: median of surv

        M[,k+l+5]: upper 100*(1-alpha)% confidence interval of the median of surv
        If the number of groups and strata is equal to 1, M will have 4 columns with
        M[,1]: total number of events
        M[,2]: median of surv
        M[,3]: lower 100*(1-alpha)% confidence interval of the median of surv
        M[,4]: upper 100*(1-alpha)% confidence interval of the median of surv
    :return: If survival data from multiple groups available and ttype=log-rank or wilcoxon,
