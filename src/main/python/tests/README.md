# Python Test

Tests are easily executed using unittest:

But before executing the tests it is recommended to go through systemds [Setting SYSTEMDS_ROOT environment](/bin/README.md)

```bash
# Single thread:
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'

# Parallel
unittest-parallel -t . -s tests --module-fixtures
```

This command searches through the test directory and finds all python files starting with `test_` and executes them.

The only tests not executed using the above commands are `Federated Tests`.

## Federated Tests

To execute the Federated Tests, use:

```bash
./tests/federated/runFedTest.sh
```

Federated experiments are a little different from the rest, since they require some setup in form of federated workers.

See more details in the [script](federated/runFedTest.sh)
