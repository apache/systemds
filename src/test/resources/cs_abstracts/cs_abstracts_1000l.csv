"Towards Microservices and Beyond: An incoming Paradigm Shift in
  Distributed Computing","The microservice architecture is a style inspired by service-oriented
computing that has recently started gaining popularity and that promises to
change the way in which software is perceived, conceived and designed. In this
paper we offer a short overview intended as a collection of bibliographic
references and links in the field of Microservices Science and Engineering

Discriminative Information Retrieval for Knowledge Discovery,"We propose a framework for discriminative Information Retrieval (IR) atop
linguistic features, trained to improve the recall of tasks such as answer
candidate passage retrieval, the initial step in text-based Question Answering
(QA). We formalize this as an instance of linear feature-based IR (Metzler and
Croft, 2007), illustrating how a variety of knowledge discovery tasks are
captured under this approach, leading to a 44% improvement in recall for
candidate triage for QA.",['cs.IR'],2016-10-06,1610.01901,2016
"Downlink Coordinated Joint Transmission for Mutual Information
  Accumulation","In this letter, we propose a new coordinated multipoint (CoMP) technique
based on mutual information (MI) accumulation using rateless codes. Using a
stochastic geometry model for the cellular downlink, we quantify the
performance enhancements in coverage probability and rate due to MI
accumulation. By simulation and analysis, we show that MI accumulation using
rateless codes leads to remarkable improvements in coverage and rate for
general users and specific cell edge users.","['cs.IT', 'math.IT']",2016-10-06,1610.01897,2016
Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking By Gossip in Games on Graphs,"We consider a gossip approach for finding a Nash equilibrium in a distributed
multi-player network game. We extend previous results on Nash equilibrium
seeking to the case when the players' cost functions may be affected by the
actions of any subset of players. An interference graph is employed to
illustrate the partially-coupled cost functions and the asymmetric information
requirements. For a given interference graph, we design a generalized
communication graph so that players with possibly partially-coupled cost
functions exchange only their required information and make decisions based on
them. Using a set of standard assumptions on the cost functions, interference
and communication graphs, we prove almost sure convergence to a Nash
equilibrium for diminishing step sizes. We then quantify the effect of the
second largest eigenvalue of the expected communication matrix on the
convergence rate, and illustrate the trade-off between the parameters
associated with the communication and the interference graphs. Finally, the
efficacy of the proposed algorithm on a large-scale networked game is
demonstrated via simulation.","['cs.SY', 'cs.GT']",2016-10-06,1610.01896,2016
"A New Data Representation Based on Training Data Characteristics to
  Extract Drug Named-Entity in Medical Text","One essential task in information extraction from the medical corpus is drug
name recognition. Compared with text sources come from other domains, the
medical text is special and has unique characteristics. In addition, the
medical text mining poses more challenges, e.g., more unstructured text, the
fast growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same
drug. The mining is even more challenging due to the lack of labeled dataset
sources and external knowledge, as well as multiple token representations for a
single drug name that is more common in the real application setting. Although
many approaches have been proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems
remained with poor F-score performance (less than 0.75). This paper presents a
new treatment in data representation techniques to overcome some of those
challenges. We propose three data representation techniques based on the
characteristics of word distribution and word similarities as a result of word
embedding training. The first technique is evaluated with the standard NN
model, i.e., MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptrons). The second technique involves two
deep network classifiers, i.e., DBN (Deep Belief Networks), and SAE (Stacked
Denoising Encoders). The third technique represents the sentence as a sequence
that is evaluated with a recurrent NN model, i.e., LSTM (Long Short Term
Memory). In extracting the drug name entities, the third technique gives the
best F-score performance compared to the state of the art, with its average
F-score being 0.8645.","['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'cs.NE']",2016-10-06,1610.01891,2016
Neural-based Noise Filtering from Word Embeddings,"Word embeddings have been demonstrated to benefit NLP tasks impressively.
Yet, there is room for improvement in the vector representations, because
current word embeddings typically contain unnecessary information, i.e., noise.
We propose two novel models to improve word embeddings by unsupervised
learning, in order to yield word denoising embeddings. The word denoising
embeddings are obtained by strengthening salient information and weakening
noise in the original word embeddings, based on a deep feed-forward neural
network filter. Results from benchmark tasks show that the filtered word
denoising embeddings outperform the original word embeddings.",['cs.CL'],2016-10-06,1610.01874,2016
On Equivalent Color Transform and Four Coloring Theorem,"In this paper, we apply an equivalent color transform (ECT) for a minimal
$k$-coloring of any graph $G$. It contracts each color class of the graph to a
single vertex and produces a complete graph $K_k$ for $G$ by removing redundant
edges between any two vertices. Based on ECT, a simple proof for four color
theorem for planar graph is then proposed.",['cs.DS'],2016-10-06,1610.01865,2016
Distortion Varieties,"The distortion varieties of a given projective variety are parametrized by
duplicating coordinates and multiplying them with monomials. We study their
degrees and defining equations. Exact formulas are obtained for the case of
one-parameter distortions. These are based on Chow polytopes and Gr\""obner
bases. Multi-parameter distortions are studied using tropical geometry. The
motivation for distortion varieties comes from multi-view geometry in computer
vision. Our theory furnishes a new framework for formulating and solving
minimal problems for camera models with image distortion.","['math.AG', 'cs.CV']",2016-10-06,1610.01860,2016
"A Robust Framework for Classifying Evolving Document Streams in an
  Expert-Machine-Crowd Setting","An emerging challenge in the online classification of social media data
streams is to keep the categories used for classification up-to-date. In this
paper, we propose an innovative framework based on an Expert-Machine-Crowd
(EMC) triad to help categorize items by continuously identifying novel concepts
in heterogeneous data streams often riddled with outliers. We unify constrained
clustering and outlier detection by formulating a novel optimization problem:
COD-Means. We design an algorithm to solve the COD-Means problem and show that
COD-Means will not only help detect novel categories but also seamlessly
discover human annotation errors and improve the overall quality of the
categorization process. Experiments on diverse real data sets demonstrate that
our approach is both effective and efficient.","['cs.CL', 'cs.IR']",2016-10-06,1610.01858,2016
"Do They All Look the Same? Deciphering Chinese, Japanese and Koreans by
  Fine-Grained Deep Learning","We study to what extend Chinese, Japanese and Korean faces can be classified
and which facial attributes offer the most important cues. First, we propose a
novel way of obtaining large numbers of facial images with nationality labels.
Then we train state-of-the-art neural networks with these labeled images. We
are able to achieve an accuracy of 75.03% in the classification task, with
chances being 33.33% and human accuracy 38.89% . Further, we train multiple
facial attribute classifiers to identify the most distinctive features for each
group. We find that Chinese, Japanese and Koreans do exhibit substantial
differences in certain attributes, such as bangs, smiling, and bushy eyebrows.
Along the way, we uncover several gender-related cross-country patterns as
well. Our work, which complements existing APIs such as Microsoft Cognitive
Services and Face++, could find potential applications in tourism, e-commerce,
social media marketing, criminal justice and even counter-terrorism.",['cs.CV'],2016-10-06,1610.01854,2016
"What are teachers interested in toward educational examples? A study of
  trainees' use of video-enhanced resources","This article reports on a case study on teachers' video-enhanced education.
Considering the fact that video exemplification is a thriving practice in the
field although there is little consensus in the literature regarding its
instructional issues, it seems appropriate to focus on the activity carried out
by teachers in video-enhanced devices in order to identify promising
characteristics (nature of the examples, types of associations between them,
documentation methods, organization and scenarization, etc.). This study
involved six trainees who used, during two sessions of 45 minutes, a digital
device based on a "" pedagogy of typical professional paths "" (Durand, 2014; Ria
\& Leblanc, 2011). The goal was to better understand their use of video
exemplification and sense-making. The results indicate that student teachers
(i) preferentially target resources about ""economic rules""; (ii) plebiscite
classroom situations, always consulted; (iii) are particularly interested (even
if they are sometimes disappointed) in the experts' testimonies; (iv) initially
show a distrust toward resources assumed to be theoretical; (v) get gradually
interested in these resources during the second session. We conclude with
several empirical and technological prospects for the design of video-enhanced
devices for teacher induction.",['cs.CY'],2016-10-06,1610.01838,2016

Parallel Large-Scale Attribute Reduction on Cloud Systems,"The rapid growth of emerging information technologies and application
patterns in modern society, e.g., Internet, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing
and Tri-network Convergence, has caused the advent of the era of big data. Big
data contains huge values, however, mining knowledge from big data is a
tremendously challenging task because of data uncertainty and inconsistency.
Attribute reduction (also known as feature selection) can not only be used as
an effective preprocessing step, but also exploits the data redundancy to
reduce the uncertainty. However, existing solutions are designed 1) either for
a single machine that means the entire data must fit in the main memory and the
parallelism is limited; 2) or for the Hadoop platform which means that the data
have to be loaded into the distributed memory frequently and therefore become
inefficient. In this paper, we overcome these shortcomings for maximum
efficiency possible, and propose a unified framework for Parallel Large-scale
Attribute Reduction, termed PLAR, for big data analysis. PLAR consists of three
components: 1) Granular Computing (GrC)-based initialization: it converts a
decision table (i.e., original data representation) into a granularity
representation which reduces the amount of space and hence can be easily cached
in the distributed memory: 2) model-parallelism: it simultaneously evaluates
all feature candidates and makes attribute reduction highly parallelizable; 3)
data-parallelism: it computes the significance of an attribute in parallel
using a MapReduce-style manner. We implement PLAR with four representative
heuristic feature selection algorithms on Spark, and evaluate them on various
huge datasets, including UCI and astronomical datasets, finding our method's
advantages beyond existing solutions.","['cs.DC', 'cs.AI']",2016-10-06,1610.01807,2016
Searching Scenes by Abstracting Things,"In this paper we propose to represent a scene as an abstraction of 'things'.
We start from 'things' as generated by modern object proposals, and we
investigate their immediately observable properties: position, size, aspect
ratio and color, and those only. Where the recent successes and excitement of
the field lie in object identification, we represent the scene composition
independent of object identities. We make three contributions in this work.
First, we study simple observable properties of 'things', and call it things
syntax. Second, we propose translating the things syntax in linguistic abstract
statements and study their descriptive effect to retrieve scenes. Thirdly, we
propose querying of scenes with abstract block illustrations and study their
effectiveness to discriminate among different types of scenes. The benefit of
abstract statements and block illustrations is that we generate them directly
from the images, without any learning beforehand as in the standard attribute
learning. Surprisingly, we show that even though we use the simplest of
features from 'things' layout and no learning at all, we can still retrieve
scenes reasonably well.",['cs.CV'],2016-10-06,1610.01801,2016
"A Joint Detection-Classification Model for Audio Tagging of Weakly
  Labelled Data","Audio tagging aims to assign one or several tags to an audio clip. Most of
the datasets are weakly labelled, which means only the tags of the clip are
known, without knowing the occurrence time of the tags. The labeling of an
audio clip is often based on the audio events in the clip and no event level
label is provided to the user. Previous works have used the bag of frames model
assume the tags occur all the time, which is not the case in practice. We
propose a joint detection-classification (JDC) model to detect and classify the
audio clip simultaneously. The JDC model has the ability to attend to
informative and ignore uninformative sounds. Then only informative regions are
used for classification. Experimental results on the ""CHiME Home"" dataset show
that the JDC model reduces the equal error rate (EER) from 19.0% to 16.9%. More
interestingly, the audio event detector is trained successfully without needing
the event level label.",['cs.SD'],2016-10-06,1610.01797,2016
"Multiple Regularizations Deep Learning for Paddy Growth Stages
  Classification from LANDSAT-8","This study uses remote sensing technology that can provide information about
the condition of the earth's surface area, fast, and spatially. The study area
was in Karawang District, lying in the Northern part of West Java-Indonesia. We
address a paddy growth stages classification using LANDSAT 8 image data
obtained from multi-sensor remote sensing image taken in October 2015 to August
2016. This study pursues a fast and accurate classification of paddy growth
stages by employing multiple regularizations learning on some deep learning
methods such as DNN (Deep Neural Networks) and 1-D CNN (1-D Convolutional
Neural Networks). The used regularizations are Fast Dropout, Dropout, and Batch
Normalization. To evaluate the effectiveness, we also compared our method with
other machine learning methods such as (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random
Forest, and XGBoost). The data used are seven bands of LANDSAT-8 spectral data
samples that correspond to paddy growth stages data obtained from i-Sky (eye in
the sky) Innovation system. The growth stages are determined based on paddy
crop phenology profile from time series of LANDSAT-8 images. The classification
results show that MLP using multiple regularization Dropout and Batch
Normalization achieves the highest accuracy for this dataset.","['cs.CV', 'cs.NE']",2016-10-06,1610.01795,2016
Predicting encounter and colocation events in metropolitan areas,"Despite an extensive literature has been devoted to mine and model mobility
features, forecasting where, when and whom people will encounter/colocate still
deserve further research efforts. Forecasting people's encounter and colocation
features is the key point for the success of many applications ranging from
epidemiology to the design of new networking paradigms and services such as
delay tolerant and opportunistic networks. While many algorithms which rely on
both mobility and social information have been proposed, we propose a novel
encounter and colocation predictive model which predicts user's encounter and
colocation events and their features by exploiting the spatio-temporal
regularity in the history of these events. We adopt weighted features Bayesian
predictor and evaluate its accuracy on two large scales WiFi and cellular

A Survey and Measurement Study of GPU DVFS on Energy Conservation,"Energy efficiency has become one of the top design criteria for current
computing systems. The dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has been
widely adopted by laptop computers, servers, and mobile devices to conserve
energy, while the GPU DVFS is still at a certain early age. This paper aims at
exploring the impact of GPU DVFS on the application performance and power
consumption, and furthermore, on energy conservation. We survey the
state-of-the-art GPU DVFS characterizations, and then summarize recent research
works on GPU power and performance models. We also conduct real GPU DVFS
experiments on NVIDIA Fermi and Maxwell GPUs. According to our experimental
results, GPU DVFS has significant potential for energy saving. The effect of
scaling core voltage/frequency and memory voltage/frequency depends on not only
the GPU architectures, but also the characteristic of GPU applications.",['cs.DC'],2016-10-06,1610.01784,2016
"Referral-Embedded Provision Point Mechanisms for Crowdfunding of Public
  Projects","Civic Crowdfunding is emerging as a popular means to mobilize funding from
citizens for public projects. A popular mechanism deployed on civic
crowdfunding platforms is a provision point mechanism, wherein, the total
contributions must reach a predetermined threshold in order for the project to
be provisioned (undertaken). Such a mechanism may have multiple equilibria;
unfortunately, in many of these equilibria, the project is not funded even if
it is highly valued among the agents. Recent work has proposed mechanisms with
refund bonuses where the project gets funded in equilibrium if its net value is
higher than a threshold among the agents who are aware of the crowdfunding
effort. In this paper, we formalize the notion of social desirability of a
public project and propose mechanisms which use the idea of referrals to expand
the pool of participants and achieve an equilibrium in which the project gets
funded if its net value exceeds a threshold among the entire agent population.
We call this new class of mechanisms Referral-Embedded Provision Point
Mechanisms (REPPM). We specifically propose two variants of REPPM and both
these mechanisms have the remarkable property that, at equilibrium, referral
bonuses are offered but there is no need for actual payment of these bonuses.
We establish that any given agent's equilibrium strategy is to refer other
agents and to contribute in proportion to the agent's true value for the
project. By referring others to contribute, an agent can, in fact, reduce his
equilibrium contribution. In our view, the proposed mechanisms will lead to an
increase in the number of projects that are funded on civic crowdfunding
platforms.",['cs.GT'],2016-10-06,1610.01768,2016
"Ischemic Stroke Identification Based on EEG and EOG using 1D
  Convolutional Neural Network and Batch Normalization","In 2015, stroke was the number one cause of death in Indonesia. The majority
type of stroke is ischemic. The standard tool for diagnosing stroke is CT-Scan.
For developing countries like Indonesia, the availability of CT-Scan is very
limited and still relatively expensive. Because of the availability, another
device that potential to diagnose stroke in Indonesia is EEG. Ischemic stroke
occurs because of obstruction that can make the cerebral blood flow (CBF) on a
person with stroke has become lower than CBF on a normal person (control) so
that the EEG signal have a deceleration. On this study, we perform the ability
of 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) to construct classification model
that can distinguish the EEG and EOG stroke data from EEG and EOG control data.
To accelerate training process our model we use Batch Normalization. Involving
62 person data object and from leave one out the scenario with five times
repetition of measurement we obtain the average of accuracy 0.86 (F-Score
0.861) only at 200 epoch. This result is better than all over shallow and
popular classifiers as the comparator (the best result of accuracy 0.69 and
F-Score 0.72 ). The feature used in our study were only 24 handcrafted feature
with simple feature extraction process.","['cs.LG', 'cs.NE']",2016-10-06,1610.01757,2016
A general lower bound for collaborative tree exploration,"We consider collaborative graph exploration with a set of $k$ agents. All
agents start at a common vertex of an initially unknown graph and need to
collectively visit all other vertices. We assume agents are deterministic,
vertices are distinguishable, moves are simultaneous, and we allow agents to
communicate globally. For this setting, we give the first non-trivial lower
bounds that bridge the gap between small ($k \leq \sqrt n$) and large ($k \geq
n$) teams of agents. Remarkably, our bounds tightly connect to existing results
in both domains.
  First, we significantly extend a lower bound of $\Omega(\log k / \log\log k)$
by Dynia et al. on the competitive ratio of a collaborative tree exploration
strategy to the range $k \leq n \log^c n$ for any $c \in \mathbb{N}$. Second,
we provide a tight lower bound on the number of agents needed for any
competitive exploration algorithm. In particular, we show that any
collaborative tree exploration algorithm with $k = Dn^{1+o(1)}$ agents has a
competitive ratio of $\omega(1)$, while Dereniowski et al. gave an algorithm
with $k = Dn^{1+\varepsilon}$ agents and competitive ratio $O(1)$, for any
$\varepsilon > 0$ and with $D$ denoting the diameter of the graph. Lastly, we
show that, for any exploration algorithm using $k = n$ agents, there exist
trees of arbitrarily large height $D$ that require $\Omega(D^2)$ rounds, and we
provide a simple algorithm that matches this bound for all trees.","['cs.DM', 'cs.DS']",2016-10-06,1610.01753,2016

fixed-to-variable length coding with a regular cost function by allowing the
error probability up to a constant $\varepsilon$. For a fixed-to-variable
length code, we call the set of source sequences that can be decoded without
error the dominant set of source sequences. For any two regular cost functions,
it is revealed that the dominant set of source sequences for a code attaining
the minimum achievable rate with a cost function is also the dominant set for a
code attaining the minimum achievable rate with the other cost function. We
also give a general formula of the second-order minimum achievable rate.","['cs.IT', 'math.IT']",2016-10-06,1610.01749,2016
"Combining Generative and Discriminative Neural Networks for Sleep Stages
  Classification","Sleep stages pattern provides important clues in diagnosing the presence of
sleep disorder. By analyzing sleep stages pattern and extracting its features
from EEG, EOG, and EMG signals, we can classify sleep stages. This study
presents a novel classification model for predicting sleep stages with a high
accuracy. The main idea is to combine the generative capability of Deep Belief
Network (DBN) with a discriminative ability and sequence pattern recognizing
capability of Long Short-term Memory (LSTM). We use DBN that is treated as an
automatic higher level features generator. The input to DBN is 28 ""handcrafted""
features as used in previous sleep stages studies. We compared our method with
other techniques which combined DBN with Hidden Markov Model (HMM).In this
study, we exploit the sequence or time series characteristics of sleep dataset.
To the best of our knowledge, most of the present sleep analysis from
polysomnogram relies only on single instanced label (nonsequence) for
classification. In this study, we used two datasets: an open data set that is
treated as a benchmark; the other dataset is our sleep stages dataset
(available for download) to verify the results further. Our experiments showed
that the combination of DBN with LSTM gives better overall accuracy 98.75\%
(Fscore=0.9875) for benchmark dataset and 98.94\% (Fscore=0.9894) for MKG
dataset. This result is better than the state of the art of sleep stages

Computer Network Defense Through Radial Wave Functions,"The purpose of this research was to synthesize basic and fundamental findings
in quantum computing, as applied to the attack and defense of conventional
computer networks. The concept focuses on uses of radio waves as a shield for,
and attack against traditional computers. A logic bomb is analogous to a
landmine in a computer network, and if one was to implement it as non-trivial
mitigation, it will aid computer network defense. As has been seen in kinetic
warfare, the use of landmines has been devastating to geopolitical regions in
that they are severely difficult for a civilian to avoid triggering given the
unknown position of a landmine. Thus, the importance of understanding a logic
bomb is relevant and has corollaries to quantum mechanics as well. The research
synthesizes quantum logic phase shifts in certain respects using the Dynamic
Data Exchange protocol in software written for this work, as well as a C-NOT
gate applied to a virtual quantum circuit environment by implementing a Quantum
Fourier Transform. The research focus applies the principles of coherence and
entanglement from quantum physics, the concept of expert systems in artificial
intelligence, principles of prime number based cryptography with trapdoor
functions, and modeling radio wave propagation against an event from unknown
parameters. This comes as a program relying on the artificial intelligence
concept of an expert system in conjunction with trigger events for a trapdoor
function relying on infinite recursion, as well as system mechanics for
elliptic curve cryptography along orbital angular momenta. Here trapdoor both
denotes the form of cipher, as well as the implied relationship to logic bombs.",['cs.CR'],2016-10-06,1610.01734,2016
"Towards Cognitive Exploration through Deep Reinforcement Learning for
  Mobile Robots","Exploration in an unknown environment is the core functionality for mobile
robots. Learning-based exploration methods, including convolutional neural
networks, provide excellent strategies without human-designed logic for the
feature extraction. But the conventional supervised learning algorithms cost
lots of efforts on the labeling work of datasets inevitably. Scenes not
included in the training set are mostly unrecognized either. We propose a deep
reinforcement learning method for the exploration of mobile robots in an indoor
environment with the depth information from an RGB-D sensor only. Based on the
Deep Q-Network framework, the raw depth image is taken as the only input to
estimate the Q values corresponding to all moving commands. The training of the
network weights is end-to-end. In arbitrarily constructed simulation
environments, we show that the robot can be quickly adapted to unfamiliar
scenes without any man-made labeling. Besides, through analysis of receptive
fields of feature representations, deep reinforcement learning motivates the
convolutional networks to estimate the traversability of the scenes. The test
results are compared with the exploration strategies separately based on deep
learning or reinforcement learning. Even trained only in the simulated
environment, experimental results in real-world environment demonstrate that
the cognitive ability of robot controller is dramatically improved compared
with the supervised method. We believe it is the first time that raw sensor
information is used to build cognitive exploration strategy for mobile robots
through end-to-end deep reinforcement learning.",['cs.RO'],2016-10-06,1610.01733,2016

great sense for pathology diagnosis and decision system of medical robots. The
multi-channel fMRI data provide more information of the pathological features.
But the increased amount of data causes complexity in feature detection. This
paper proposes a principal component analysis (PCA)-aided fully convolutional
network to particularly deal with multi-channel fMRI. We transfer the learned
weights of contemporary classification networks to the segmentation task by
fine-tuning. The experiments results are compared with various methods e.g.
k-NN. A new labelling strategy is proposed to solve the semantic segmentation
problem with unclear boundaries. Even with a small-sized training dataset, the
test results demonstrate that our model outperforms other pathological feature
detection methods. Besides, its forward inference only takes 90 milliseconds
for a single set of fMRI data. To our knowledge, this is the first time to
realize pixel-wise labeling of multi-channel magnetic resonance image using
FCN.","['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']",2016-10-06,1610.01732,2016
"RedThreads: An Interface for Application-level Fault
  Detection/Correction through Adaptive Redundant Multithreading","In the presence of accelerated fault rates, which are projected to be the
norm on future exascale systems, it will become increasingly difficult for
high-performance computing (HPC) applications to accomplish useful computation.
Due to the fault-oblivious nature of current HPC programming paradigms and
execution environments, HPC applications are insufficiently equipped to deal
with errors. We believe that HPC applications should be enabled with
capabilities to actively search for and correct errors in their computations.
The redundant multithreading (RMT) approach offers lightweight replicated
execution streams of program instructions within the context of a single
application process. However, the use of complete redundancy incurs significant
overhead to the application performance.
  In this paper we present RedThreads, an interface that provides
application-level fault detection and correction based on RMT, but applies the
thread-level redundancy adaptively. We describe the RedThreads syntax and
semantics, and the supporting compiler infrastructure and runtime system. Our
approach enables application programmers to scope the extent of redundant
computation. Additionally, the runtime system permits the use of RMT to be
dynamically enabled, or disabled, based on the resiliency needs of the
application and the state of the system. Our experimental results demonstrate
how adaptive RMT exploits programmer insight and runtime inference to
dynamically navigate the trade-off space between an application's resilience
coverage and the associated performance overhead of redundant computation.",['cs.DC'],2016-10-06,1610.01728,2016
Distance rationalization of anonymous and homogeneous voting rules,"The concept of distance rationalizability of voting rules has been explored
in recent years by several authors. Most previous work has dealt with a
definition in terms of preference profiles. However, most voting rules in
common use are anonymous and homogeneous. In this case there is a much more
succinct representation (using the voting simplex) of the inputs to the rule.
This representation has been widely used in the voting literature, but rarely
in the context of distance rationalizability.
  Recently, the present authors showed, as a special case of general results on
quotient spaces, exactly how to connect distance rationalizability on profiles
for anonymous and homogeneous rules to geometry in the simplex. In this article
we develop the connection for the important special case of votewise distances,
recently introduced and studied by Elkind, Faliszewski and Slinko in several
papers. This yields a direct interpretation in terms of well-developed
mathematical topics not seen before in the voting literature, namely
Kantorovich (also called Wasserstein) distances and the geometry of Minkowski
spaces.
  As an application of this approach, we prove some positive and some negative
results about the decisiveness of distance rationalizable anonymous and
homogeneous rules. The positive results connect with the recent theory of
hyperplane rules, while the negative ones deal with distances that are not
metrics, controversial notions of consensus, and the fact that the
$\ell^1$-norm is not strictly convex.
  We expect that the above novel geometric interpretation will aid the analysis
of rules defined by votewise distances, and the discovery of new rules with
desirable properties.",['cs.GT'],2016-10-06,1610.01900,2016
"Efficient Best-Response Computation for Strategic Network Formation
  under Attack","Strategic network formation models the uncoordinated creation of a network by
selfish agents. Inspired by real world examples, e.g. the Internet, researchers
have introduced an abundance of strategic games to study natural phenomena in
networks. Most of these games have the conceptual drawback of being
computationally intractable. For example, computing a best response strategy or
checking whether an equilibrium is reached is NP-hard. Thus, a main challenge
in the field is to find models which incorporate many interesting features and
to devise efficient algorithms for solving the entailed computational tasks.
  We address this challenge by providing an efficient algorithm to compute a
best response strategy for a recently introduced model, thereby answering the
open question posed by Goyal et al. [WINE'16]. Their promising model focuses on
network robustness by considering an adversary who attacks (and kills) nodes in
the network and lets this attack spread virus-like to neighboring nodes.
  Additionally, we augment their model by introducing a less predictable
adversary and show that our algorithm, with minor modifications, can cope with
this more complex scenario.","['cs.GT', 'cs.DM', 'cs.DS', 'cs.NI']",2016-10-06,1610.01861,2016
Distance rationalization of social rules,"The concept of distance rationalizability of social choice rules has been
explored in recent years by several authors. We deal here with several
foundational questions, and unify, correct, and generalize previous work. For
example, we study a new question involving uniqueness of representation in the
distance rationalizability framework, and present a counterexample.
  For rules satisfying various axiomatic properties such as anonymity,
neutrality and homogeneity, the standard profile representation of input can be
compressed substantially. We explain in detail using quotient constructions and
symmetry groups how distance rationalizability is interpreted in this
situation. This enables us to connect the theory of distance rationalizability
with geometric concepts such as Earth Mover distance and optimal
transportation. We expect this connection to prove fruitful in future work.
  We improve on the best-known sufficient conditions for rules rationalized via
votewise distances to satisfy anonymity, neutrality, homogeneity, consistency
and continuity. This leads to a class of well-behaved rules which deserve
closer scrutiny in future.",['cs.GT'],2016-10-06,1610.01902,2016
Connecting Generative Adversarial Networks and Actor-Critic Methods,"Both generative adversarial networks (GAN) in unsupervised learning and
actor-critic methods in reinforcement learning (RL) have gained a reputation
for being difficult to optimize. Practitioners in both fields have amassed a
large number of strategies to mitigate these instabilities and improve
training. Here we show that GANs can be viewed as actor-critic methods in an
environment where the actor cannot affect the reward. We review the strategies
for stabilizing training for each class of models, both those that generalize
between the two and those that are particular to that model. We also review a
number of extensions to GANs and RL algorithms with even more complicated
information flow. We hope that by highlighting this formal connection we will
encourage both GAN and RL communities to develop general, scalable, and stable
algorithms for multilevel optimization with deep networks, and to draw
inspiration across communities.","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2016-10-06,1610.01945,2016
"Geometric decoding of subspace codes with explicit Schubert calculus
  applied to spread codes","This article is about a decoding algorithm for error-correcting subspace
codes. A version of this algorithm was previously described by Rosenthal,
Silberstein and Trautmann. The decoding algorithm requires the code to be
defined as the intersection of the Pl\""ucker embedding of the Grassmannian and
an algebraic variety. We call such codes \emph{geometric subspace codes}.
Complexity is substantially improved compared to the algorithm by Rosenthal,
Silberstein and Trautmann and connections to finite geometry are given. The
decoding algorithm is applied to Desarguesian spread codes, which are known to

Scalable Machine Translation in Memory Constrained Environments,"Machine translation is the discipline concerned with developing automated
tools for translating from one human language to another. Statistical machine
translation (SMT) is the dominant paradigm in this field. In SMT, translations
are generated by means of statistical models whose parameters are learned from
bilingual data. Scalability is a key concern in SMT, as one would like to make
use of as much data as possible to train better translation systems.
  In recent years, mobile devices with adequate computing power have become
widely available. Despite being very successful, mobile applications relying on
NLP systems continue to follow a client-server architecture, which is of
limited use because access to internet is often limited and expensive. The goal
of this dissertation is to show how to construct a scalable machine translation
system that can operate with the limited resources available on a mobile
device.
  The main challenge for porting translation systems on mobile devices is
memory usage. The amount of memory available on a mobile device is far less
than what is typically available on the server side of a client-server
application. In this thesis, we investigate alternatives for the two components
which prevent standard translation systems from working on mobile devices due
to high memory usage. We show that once these standard components are replaced
with our proposed alternatives, we obtain a scalable translation system that
can work on a device with limited memory.",['cs.CL'],2016-10-06,1610.02003,2016
"Fundamental properties of solutions to utility maximization problems in
  wireless networks","We introduce a unified framework for the study of utility maximization
problems in interference-coupled wireless networks. The framework can be
applied to a large class of utilities, but in this study special attention is
devoted to the rate. In more detail, we resort to results from concave
Perron-Frobenius theory to show that, within the class of problems we consider
here, each problem has a unique solution. As a consequence, given any network
utility maximization problem belonging to this class, we can define two
functions that relate the power budget $\bar{p}$ of a network to the network
utility and to the energy efficiency achieved by the solution to the given
problem. Among many interesting properties, we prove that these functions are
continuous and monotonic. In addition, we derive bounds revealing that the
solution is characterized by a low and a high power regime. In the low power
regime, the energy efficiency can decrease slowly as the power budget
increases, and the network utility grows linearly at best. In contrast, in the
high power regime, the energy efficiency typically scales as
$\mathcal{O}(1/\bar{p})$ as $\bar{p}\to\infty$, and the network utility scales
as $\mathcal{O}(1)$. We apply the theoretical findings to a novel weighted rate
maximization problem involving the joint optimization of the uplink power and
the base station assignment. For this novel problem formulation, we also
propose a simple and practical iterative solver.","['cs.IT', 'cs.NI', 'math.IT']",2016-10-06,1610.01988,2016
Active exploration in parameterized reinforcement learning,"Online model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods with continuous actions
are playing a prominent role when dealing with real-world applications such as
Robotics. However, when confronted to non-stationary environments, these
methods crucially rely on an exploration-exploitation trade-off which is rarely
dynamically and automatically adjusted to changes in the environment. Here we
propose an active exploration algorithm for RL in structured (parameterized)
continuous action space. This framework deals with a set of discrete actions,
each of which is parameterized with continuous variables. Discrete exploration
is controlled through a Boltzmann softmax function with an inverse temperature
$\beta$ parameter. In parallel, a Gaussian exploration is applied to the
continuous action parameters. We apply a meta-learning algorithm based on the
comparison between variations of short-term and long-term reward running
averages to simultaneously tune $\beta$ and the width of the Gaussian
distribution from which continuous action parameters are drawn. When applied to
a simple virtual human-robot interaction task, we show that this algorithm
outperforms continuous parameterized RL both without active exploration and
with active exploration based on uncertainty variations measured by a
Kalman-Q-learning algorithm.",['cs.LG'],2016-10-06,1610.01986,2016
"Driving in the Matrix: Can Virtual Worlds Replace Human-Generated
  Annotations for Real World Tasks?","Deep learning has rapidly transformed the state of the art algorithms used to
address a variety of problems in computer vision and robotics. These
breakthroughs have however relied upon massive amounts of human annotated
training data. This time-consuming process has begun impeding the progress of
these deep learning efforts. This paper describes a method to incorporate
photo-realistic computer images from a simulation engine to rapidly generate
annotated data that can be used for training of machine learning algorithms. We
demonstrate that a state of the art architecture, which is trained only using
these synthetic annotations, performs better than the identical architecture
trained on human annotated real-world data, when tested on the KITTI data set
for vehicle detection. By training machine learning algorithms on a rich
virtual world, this paper illustrates that real objects in real scenes can be
learned and classified using synthetic data. This approach offers the
possibility of accelerating deep learning's application to sensor based

"Quantum Game Theory for Beam Alignment in Millimeter Wave
  Device-to-Device Communications","In this paper, the problem of optimized beam alignment for wearable
device-to-device (D2D) communications over millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies is
studied. In particular, a noncooperative game is formulated between wearable
communication pairs that engage in D2D communications. In this game, wearable
devices acting as transmitters autonomously select the directions of their
beams so as to maximize the data rate to their receivers. To solve the game, an
algorithm based on best response dynamics is proposed that allows the
transmitters to reach a Nash equilibrium in a distributed manner. To further
improve the performance of mmW D2D communications, a novel quantum game model
is formulated to enable the wearable devices to exploit new quantum directions
during their beam alignment so as to further enhance their data rate.
Simulation results show that the proposed game-theoretic approach improves the
performance, in terms of data rate, of about 75% compared to a uniform beam
alignment. The results also show that the quantum game model can further yield
up to 20% improvement in data rates, relative to the classical game approach.","['cs.IT', 'cs.GT', 'math.IT']",2016-10-06,1610.01982,2016
A Vision-based Indoor Positioning System on Shopping Mall Context,"With the help of a map and GPS, outdoor navigation from one spot to another
can be done quickly and well. Unfortunately, inside a shopping mall, where GPS
signal is hardly available, navigation becomes troublesome. In this paper, we
propose an indoor navigation system to address the problem. Unlike most
existing indoor navigation systems, which relies heavily on infrastructures and
pre-labelled maps, our system uses only photos taken by cellphone cameras as
input. We utilize multiple image processing techniques to parse photos of a
mall's shopping instruction and a construct topological map of the mall. During
navigation, we make use of deep neural networks to extract information from
environment and find out the real-time position of the user. We propose a new
feature fusion method to help automatically identifying shops in a photo.",['cs.CV'],2016-10-06,1610.01906,2016
DeepDGA: Adversarially-Tuned Domain Generation and Detection,"Many malware families utilize domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to
establish command and control (C&C) connections. While there are many methods
to pseudorandomly generate domains, we focus in this paper on detecting (and
generating) domains on a per-domain basis which provides a simple and flexible
means to detect known DGA families. Recent machine learning approaches to DGA
detection have been successful on fairly simplistic DGAs, many of which produce
names of fixed length. However, models trained on limited datasets are somewhat
blind to new DGA variants.
  In this paper, we leverage the concept of generative adversarial networks to
construct a deep learning based DGA that is designed to intentionally bypass a
deep learning based detector. In a series of adversarial rounds, the generator
learns to generate domain names that are increasingly more difficult to detect.
In turn, a detector model updates its parameters to compensate for the
adversarially generated domains. We test the hypothesis of whether
adversarially generated domains may be used to augment training sets in order
to harden other machine learning models against yet-to-be-observed DGAs. We
detail solutions to several challenges in training this character-based
generative adversarial network (GAN). In particular, our deep learning
architecture begins as a domain name auto-encoder (encoder + decoder) trained
on domains in the Alexa one million. Then the encoder and decoder are
reassembled competitively in a generative adversarial network (detector +
generator), with novel neural architectures and training strategies to improve
convergence.",['cs.CR'],2016-10-06,1610.01969,2016
Fast Hierarchy Construction for Dense Subgraphs,"Discovering dense subgraphs and understanding the relations among them is a
fundamental problem in graph mining. We want to not only identify dense
subgraphs, but also build a hierarchy among them (e.g., larger but sparser
subgraphs formed by two smaller dense subgraphs). Peeling algorithms (k-core,
k-truss, and nucleus decomposition) have been effective to locate many dense
subgraphs. However, constructing a hierarchical representation of density
structure, even correctly computing the connected k-cores and k-trusses, have
been mostly overlooked. Keeping track of connected components during peeling
requires an additional traversal operation, which is as expensive as the
peeling process. In this paper, we start with a thorough survey and point to
nuances in problem formulations that lead to significant differences in
runtimes. We then propose efficient and generic algorithms to construct the
hierarchy of dense subgraphs for k-core, k-truss, or any nucleus decomposition.
Our algorithms leverage the disjoint-set forest data structure to efficiently
construct the hierarchy during traversal. Furthermore, we introduce a new idea
to avoid traversal. We construct the subgraphs while visiting neighborhoods in
the peeling process, and build the relations to previously constructed
subgraphs. We also consider an existing idea to find the k-core hierarchy and
adapt for our objectives efficiently. Experiments on different types of large
scale real-world networks show significant speedups over naive algorithms and
existing alternatives. Our algorithms also outperform the hypothetical limits
of any possible traversal-based solution.",['cs.SI'],2016-10-06,1610.01961,2016
Efficient L1-Norm Principal-Component Analysis via Bit Flipping,"It was shown recently that the $K$ L1-norm principal components (L1-PCs) of a
real-valued data matrix $\mathbf X \in \mathbb R^{D \times N}$ ($N$ data
samples of $D$ dimensions) can be exactly calculated with cost
$\mathcal{O}(2^{NK})$ or, when advantageous, $\mathcal{O}(N^{dK - K + 1})$
where $d=\mathrm{rank}(\mathbf X)$, $K<d$ [1],[2]. In applications where
$\mathbf X$ is large (e.g., ""big"" data of large $N$ and/or ""heavy"" data of
large $d$), these costs are prohibitive. In this work, we present a novel
suboptimal algorithm for the calculation of the $K < d$ L1-PCs of $\mathbf X$
of cost $\mathcal O(ND \mathrm{min} \{ N,D\} + N^2(K^4 + dK^2) + dNK^3)$, which
is comparable to that of standard (L2-norm) PC analysis. Our theoretical and
experimental studies show that the proposed algorithm calculates the exact
optimal L1-PCs with high frequency and achieves higher value in the L1-PC
optimization metric than any known alternative algorithm of comparable
computational cost. The superiority of the calculated L1-PCs over standard
L2-PCs (singular vectors) in characterizing potentially faulty
data/measurements is demonstrated with experiments on data dimensionality
reduction and disease diagnosis from genomic data.","['cs.DS', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2016-10-06,1610.01959,2016

"PetroSurf3D - A high-resolution 3D Dataset of Rock Art for Surface

Reconstruction results demonstrate the strengths of novel 3D techniques and
have the potential to replace the traditional (manual) documentation techniques

  An important analysis task in rock art documentation is the segmentation of

different petroglyphs together with accurate expert ground-truth annotations.
To our knowledge, this dataset is the first public 3D surface dataset which

that the size and variability of the data is sufficient to successfully adopt

"The Moser-Tardos lopsidependency criterion can be stronger than
  Shearer's criterion","The Lopsided Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma (LLLL) is a probabilistic tool which is a
cornerstone of the probabilistic method of combinatorics, which shows that it
is possible to avoid a collection of ""bad"" events as long as their
probabilities and interdependencies are sufficiently small. The strongest
possible criterion that can be stated in these terms is due to Shearer (1985),
although it is technically difficult to apply to constructions in
combinatorics.
  The original formulation of the LLLL was non-constructive; a seminal
algorithm of Moser & Tardos (2010) gave an efficient constructive algorithm for
nearly all applications of it, including applications to $k$-SAT instances with
a bounded number of occurrences per variables. Harris (2015) later gave an
alternate criterion for this algorithm to converge, which appeared to give
stronger bounds than the standard LLL. Unlike the LLL criterion or its
variants, this criterion depends in a fundamental way on the decomposition of
bad-events into variables.
  In this note, we show that the criterion given by Harris can be stronger in
some cases even than Shearer's criterion. We construct $k$-SAT formulas with
bounded variable occurrence, and show that the criterion of Harris is satisfied
while the criterion of Shearer is violated. In fact, there is an exponentially
growing gap between the bounds provable from any form of the LLLL and from the
bound shown by Harris.","['math.PR', 'cs.DM', 'math.CO']",2016-10-06,1610.01926,2016
Optimal Separation in Exact Query Complexities for Simon's Problem,"\emph{Simon's problem} is one of the most important problems demonstrating
the power of quantum computers, which achieves a large separation between
quantum and classical query complexities. However, Simon's discussion on his
problem was limited to \emph{bounded-error} setting, which means his algorithm
can not always get the correct answer. \emph{Exact} quantum algorithms for
Simon's problem have also been proposed, which deterministically solve the
problem with $O(n)$ queries. Although these algorithms are either complicated
or specialized, their results give a $O(n)$ versus $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}})$
separation in exact query complexities for Simon's problem. Later results
indicate the the quantum lower bound for Simon's problem, but it has not been
proved whether this separation is optimal. In this paper, we propose another
exact quantum algorithm for solving Simon's problem with $O(n)$ queries, which
is simple, concrete and does not rely on some special query oracles. Our
algorithm combines Simon's algorithm with the quantum amplitude amplification
technique to ensure its determinism. Moreover, we show that Simon's problem can
be solved by a classically \emph{deterministic} algorithm with
$O(\sqrt{2^{n}})$ queries (as we are aware, there were no classically
deterministic algorithms for solving Simon's problem with $O(\sqrt{2^{n}})$
queries). Combining some previous results, we prove the optimal separation in

Adaptive Online Sequential ELM for Concept Drift Tackling,"A machine learning method needs to adapt to over time changes in the

adding adaptive capability for classification and regression problem. The
scheme is named as adaptive OS-ELM (AOS-ELM). It is a single classifier scheme
that works well to handle real drift, virtual drift, and hybrid drift. The
AOS-ELM also works well for sudden drift and recurrent context change type. The
scheme is a simple unified method implemented in simple lines of code. We
evaluated AOS-ELM on regression and classification problem by using concept
drift public data set (SEA and STAGGER) and other public data sets such as
MNIST, USPS, and IDS. Experiments show that our method gives higher kappa value
compared to the multiclassifier ELM ensemble. Even though AOS-ELM in practice
does not need hidden nodes increase, we address some issues related to the

"Using Non-invertible Data Transformations to Build Adversary-Resistant
  Deep Neural Networks","Deep neural networks have proven to be quite effective in a wide variety of
machine learning tasks, ranging from improved speech recognition systems to
advancing the development of autonomous vehicles. However, despite their
superior performance in many applications, these models have been recently
shown to be susceptible to a particular type of attack possible through the
generation of particular synthetic examples referred to as adversarial samples.
These samples are constructed by manipulating real examples from the training
data distribution in order to ""fool"" the original neural model, resulting in
misclassification (with high confidence) of previously correctly classified
samples. Addressing this weakness is of utmost importance if deep neural
architectures are to be applied to critical applications, such as those in the
domain of cybersecurity. In this paper, we present an analysis of this
fundamental flaw lurking in all neural architectures to uncover limitations of
previously proposed defense mechanisms. More importantly, we present a unifying

"Convex Histogram-Based Joint Image Segmentation with Regularized Optimal

setting, several transport cost functions are considered and used to match
statistical distributions of features. In practice, global multidimensional
histograms are estimated from the segmented image regions, and are compared to
referring models that are either fixed histograms given a priori, or directly
inferred in the non-supervised case. The different convex problems studied are

"A Probably Approximately Correct Answer to Distributed Stochastic
  Optimization in a Non-stationary Environment","This paper considers a distributed stochastic optimization problem where the
goal is to minimize the time average of a cost function subject to a set of
constraints on the time averages of a related stochastic processes called
penalties. We assume that a delayed information about an event in the system is
available as a common information at every user, and the state of the system is
evolving in an independent and non-stationary fashion. We show that an
approximate Drift-plus-penalty (DPP) algorithm that we propose achieves a time
average cost that is within some positive constant epsilon of the optimal cost
with high probability. Further, we provide a condition on the waiting time for
this result to hold. The condition is shown to be a function of the mixing
coefficient, the number of samples (w) used to compute an estimate of the
distribution of the state, and the delay. Unlike the existing work, the method
used in the paper can be adapted to prove high probability results when the
state is evolving in a non-i.i.d and non-stationary fashion. Under mild
conditions, we show that the dependency of the error bound on w is exponential,
which is a significant improvement compared to the exiting work.","['cs.IT', 'math.IT']",2016-10-05,1610.01405,2016
Towards semi-episodic learning for robot damage recovery,"The recently introduced Intelligent Trial and Error algorithm (IT\&E) enables
robots to creatively adapt to damage in a matter of minutes by combining an
off-line evolutionary algorithm and an on-line learning algorithm based on
Bayesian Optimization. We extend the IT\&E algorithm to allow for robots to
learn to compensate for damages while executing their task(s). This leads to a
semi-episodic learning scheme that increases the robot's lifetime autonomy and
adaptivity. Preliminary experiments on a toy simulation and a 6-legged robot
locomotion task show promising results.","['cs.RO', 'cs.AI', 'cs.NE']",2016-10-05,1610.01407,2016
Decentralized Topic Modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation,"Privacy preserving networks can be modelled as decentralized networks (e.g.,
sensors, connected objects, smartphones), where communication between nodes of
the network is not controlled by an all-knowing, central node. For this type of
networks, the main issue is to gather/learn global information on the network
(e.g., by optimizing a global cost function) while keeping the (sensitive)
information at each node. In this work, we focus on text information that
agents do not want to share (e.g., text messages, emails, confidential
reports). We use recent advances on decentralized optimization and topic models
to infer topics from a graph with limited communication. We propose a method to
adapt latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to decentralized optimization and
show on synthetic data that we still recover similar parameters and similar
performance at each node than with stochastic methods accessing to the whole
information in the graph.","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2016-10-05,1610.01417,2016
Read-Write Memory and k-Set Consensus as an Affine Task,"The wait-free read-write memory model has been characterized as an iterated
\emph{Immediate Snapshot} (IS) task. The IS task is \emph{affine}---it can be
defined as a (sub)set of simplices of the standard chromatic subdivision. It is
known that the task of \emph{Weak Symmetry Breaking} (WSB) cannot be
represented as an affine task. In this paper, we highlight the phenomenon of a
""natural"" model that can be captured by an iterated affine task and, thus, by a
subset of runs of the iterated immediate snapshot model. We show that the
read-write memory model in which, additionally, $k$-set-consensus objects can
be used is, unlike WSB, ""natural"" by presenting the corresponding simple affine
task captured by a subset of $2$-round IS runs. Our results imply the first
combinatorial characterization of models equipped with abstractions other than
read-write memory that applies to generic tasks.",['cs.DC'],2016-10-05,1610.01423,2016
"On the Joint Impact of Hardware Impairments and Imperfect CSI on
  Successive Decoding","In this paper, a spatial multiplexing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
system when hardware along with RF imperfections occur during the communication
setup is analytically investigated. More specifically, the scenario of hardware
impairments at the transceiver and imperfect channel state information (CSI) at
the receiver is considered, when successive interference cancellation (SIC) is
implemented. Two popular linear detection schemes are analyzed, namely, zero
forcing SIC (ZF-SIC) and minimum mean-square error SIC (MMSE-SIC). New
analytical expressions for the outage probability of each SIC stage are
provided, when independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels
are considered. In addition, the well-known error propagation effect between
consecutive SIC stages is analyzed, while closed-form expressions are derived
for some special cases of interest. Finally, useful engineering insights are
manifested, such as the achievable diversity order, the performance difference
between ZF- and MMSE-SIC, and the impact of imperfect CSI and/or the presence
of hardware impairments to the overall system performance.","['cs.IT', 'math.IT']",2016-10-05,1610.01426,2016

"Effective Low-Complexity Optimization Methods for Joint Phase Noise and
  Channel Estimation in OFDM","Phase noise correction is crucial to exploit full advantage of orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in modern high-data-rate communications.
OFDM channel estimation with simultaneous phase noise compensation has
therefore drawn much attention and stimulated continuing efforts. Existing
methods, however, either have not taken into account the fundamental properties
of phase noise or are only able to provide estimates of limited applicability
owing to considerable computational complexity. In this paper, we have
reformulated the joint estimation problem in the time domain as opposed to
existing frequency-domain approaches, which enables us to develop much more
efficient algorithms using the majorization-minimization technique. In
addition, we propose a method based on dimensionality reduction and the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) that can adapt to various phase noise
levels and accomplish much lower mean squared error than the benchmarks without
incurring much additional computational cost. Several numerical examples with
phase noise generated by free-running oscillators or phase-locked loops
demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform existing methods with
respect to both computational efficiency and mean squared error within a large
range of signal-to-noise ratios.","['cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'math.OC']",2016-10-05,1610.01433,2016
Markov Chain Modeling and Simulation of Breathing Patterns,"The lack of large video databases obtained from real patients with
respiratory disorders makes the design and optimization of video-based
monitoring systems quite critical. The purpose of this study is the development
of suitable models and simulators of breathing behaviors and disorders, such as
respiratory pauses and apneas, in order to allow efficient design and test of
video-based monitoring systems. More precisely, a novel Continuous-Time Markov
Chain (CTMC) statistical model of breathing patterns is presented. The
Respiratory Rate (RR) pattern, estimated by measured vital signs of
hospital-monitored patients, is approximated as a CTMC, whose states and
parameters are selected through an appropriate statistical analysis. Then, two
simulators, software- and hardware-based, are proposed. After validation of the
CTMC model, the proposed simulators are tested with previously developed
video-based algorithms for the estimation of the RR and the detection of apnea
events. Examples of application to assess the performance of systems for
video-based RR estimation and apnea detection are presented. The results, in
terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence, show that realistic breathing patterns,
including specific respiratory disorders, can be accurately described by the
proposed model; moreover, the simulators are able to reproduce practical
breathing patterns for video analysis. The presented CTMC statistical model can
be strategic to describe realistic breathing patterns and devise simulators
useful to develop and test novel and effective video processing-based
monitoring systems.","['stat.AP', 'cs.CV']",2016-10-05,1610.01444,2016
Efficiency and Budget Balance,"We study efficiency and budget balance for designing mechanisms in general
quasi-linear domains. Green and Laffont (1979) proved that one cannot
generically achieve both. We consider strategyproof budget-balanced mechanisms
that are approximately efficient. For deterministic mechanisms, we show that a
strategyproof and budget-balanced mechanism must have a sink agent whose
valuation function is ignored in selecting an alternative, and she is
compensated with the payments made by the other agents. We assume the
valuations of the agents come from a bounded open interval. Using this result,
we find a tight lower bound on the inefficiencies of strategyproof,
