"If i had a dollar for how many times I have played this cd and how many times I have asked Alexa to play it, I would be rich. Love this singer along with the Black Pumas. Finding a lot of new music that I like a lot on amazon. Try new things.",i
awesome sound - cant wait to see them in person - always miss them when they are in town !,L
This is a great cd. Good music and plays well. Seller responded back very quicky and  received it within 3 days,s

"I first heard this playing in a Nagoya shop and fell in love with the remix of Ke$ha's ""Tik Tok"" (Ke$ha and Lady Gaga are EVERYWHERE in Japan), which then morphed into several other recent pop hits. When the salesgirl handed me the CD, I was pleased to see that it actually included thirty pop songs by the likes of Lady Gaga, Usher, La Roux, Katy Perry, Black-Eyed Peas, Ke$ha, etc. I researched more after I got home, and discovered that this Japanese label (Manhattan Records) exists solely to put out rerecorded and remixed dance CDs based on recent pop hits, the key word being rerecorded. I guessed as much as I was listening to the CD in-store; several of the soundalikes do a great job, others are just so-so. It's great for workouts, though, since the tracks fade one into another with no downtime (the bad side is that if you've got in in shuffle, the beginning of the next song, which is often in a different key, is kind of an awkward fade-out when not played in sequence).",R
"I just saw ""Star Wars: L'attaque des clones"" last night (in Ste-Foy, Québec) at a sold-out show (it was playing in English at the theatre next door but I opted for the French version instead). First of all, the theatre itself was an experience: an immense screen that looked as large as an IMAX screen, intense surround THX sound, and the digital picture (even at that size) was amazingly crisp, the colours vibrant, and the sound effects were ear-splitting and exhilarating (especially the moments of silence that preceded the sonic depth charge explosions!)I have seen the other four Star Wars movies but avoided reading publicity and reviews for ""Attack of the Clones"" in order to enjoy every moment without worrying over a particular critic's faults with the film. This film is much darker than ""The Phantom Menace"" could have ever aspired to be. Lucas has moved from stilted, juvenile scriptwriting on ""TPM"" to (still) stilted, mythological, more adult scriptwriting on ""Attack of the Clones."" Here we see Anakin as a headstrong, angry, frequently obnoxious young adult who loves backtalking, disobeying orders, and getting his way--a most dangerous thing when you are destined to become the most powerful Jedi of all time.The dialogue is very politically minded (I had to wonder at the ""separatist"" politics of the film, being in Québec) and the romance scenes feel wooden and awkward, but Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen definitely have onscreen chemistry. (I have since read that Hayden purposely would flash a thumbs-up at the end of his takes so Lucas would have to reshoot the kissing scenes...I did get a laugh out of that.)Jar Jar Binks has (thankfully) been reduced to a few mere minutes of screentime, in which he manages to be (awkwardly) regal and somewhat less annoying that in Episode I. My favourite part of the ""Star Wars"" universe has always been the astonishing variety of aliens and alien languages...when I was a kid I wanted to be the one that came up with all the cool sounding languages spoken in the film (I still do as a matter of fact).As usual, Natalie Portman's costumes are to die for, incorporating Asian and European fashion influences while still managing to be gracefully fresh and exotic. Only one I could have done without was the black leather getup ---elbow-high leather gloves and a black leather bustier, yet she's telling Anakin she's not interested in a romantic relationship...riiiight (Curiously enough, Anakin wears black leather as well...and if you listen carefully you can hear a whole lot of leather creaking onscreen). Portman certainly runs around baring her abs-of-steel midriff for much of the film (along with being very braless in a very tight white jumpsuit, which I found tasteless and unnecessary...I mean, the costumers spent the last film and part of this one coming up with these gorgeous gowns and now they're raiding Lara Croft's closet?)The CGI imagery was breathtaking, especially the chase through Coruscant, the clone army and all of the alien landscapes. John Williams' score incorporates themes from all of the previous ""Star Wars"" soundtracks, including the addition of a new love theme, ""Across the Stars."" The fight scenes were white-knuckle intense and had me on the edge of my seat. The battle scene with all of the Jedis of all different species was *awesome,* as was Mace Windu's (Samuel L. Jackson) purple lightsaber...a first in ""Star Wars"" history. And Yoda: we finally see him in action and understand why he is the greatest living Jedi. Another first: Yoda is completely computer-animated, and is extremely lifelike.The French translation of the film was almost an exact translation from the English...I actually found that some of the dialogue flowed more smoothly in French. Understanding some of the alien accents (especially the metallic robot ones) was a bit of a challenge for me, but it adds to the fun.Lucas has effectively planted the seeds for the next and final chapter in the ""Star Wars"" saga, redeeming himself from the sometimes mediocre acting, wooden dialogue and annoying creatures from ""The Phantom Menace"".Episode II is full of treachery, death, assassination attempts, massacres, and battles between good and evil where right and wrong are sometimes obscured. Unlike Jake Lloyd, the child actor who played Anakin in ""The Phantom Menace,"" in Hayden we see Anakin torn between his inner feelings and his obligations as a Jedi...his romance with Padmé, the (implied) massacre of the Tusken camp, and his defiance, all pointing to his shift to the Dark Side of the Force.The film is rated PG, but it does contain some very intense moments: onscreen kissing and sexual tension of sorts, a decapitation, mutilation, creepy space caterpillars, a gladiator-style execution arena, a massacre and other intense battle scenes and that might be disturbing to younger children. But overall it is a very worthy addition to the ""Star Wars"" universe. Can't wait until Episode III!",F
"This is without a doubt my favorite CD, and I may be close to wearing it out before the end of the month  LOL  Personally, I never looked at the song list, just popped it in the player and let 'er rip.

"With movies taking over Elvis' post-army career, their soundtracks, naturally, became the main focus of his album release schedule.  The annual barrage of soundtrack LPs and EPs would yield enough space for just one new studio LP and one or two singles per year in his busy release schedule.  ""Elvis is Back!"" (1960), ""Something for Everybody"" (1961), ""Pot Luck"" (1962), plus the ""His Hand in Mine"" gospel album (released at Christmas, 1960 and a steady catalog seller), were all well received best-sellers.  So, when Elvis entered RCA's Studio B in Nashville in May of 1963, it was expected by fans to be for the purpose of recording a new non-movie LP to follow up the previous year's ""Pot Luck with Elvis"" album.  The big summer '63 single (Devil in Disguise) whet the fanbase appetite for a new studio LP, and then ... a Greatest Hits set (Elvis' Golden Records, Volume 3) was issued, followed by yet another soundtrack album (""Fun in Acapulco"").  The recordings that made up what came to be known as ""The Lost Album"" would be sliced and diced and served up as various singles A-sides and B-sides, EP filler (""Tickle Me""), soundtrack album 'bonus songs,' and patched together album fodder (""Elvis for Everyone!"") over the following five years.  And it's a plain shame, because it didn't have to be that way.  ""Golden Records Volume 3"" could've / should've been held back for summer '64 release since RCA didn't see fit to issue a ""Viva Las Vegas!"" soundtrack album, despite the runaway success of the movie, leaving a wide-open space in the summer '64 schedule -- the perfect slot for ""Golden Records Volume 3.""  After ""Kissin' Cousins"" (March '64) another new Elvis LP wouldn't turn up until the ""Roustabout"" soundtrack was released in late November.  A more than worthy follow-up to the Top 5 success of ""Pot Luck,"" the so-called Lost Album would have met with great success in 1963, a time when Elvis' recording career momentum could surely have used a boost.  Sales of the recent ""It Happened at the World's Fair"" soundtrack had been tepid, by Elvis' standards.  More importantly, 'Lost' was / is a fine stand-alone album.  As was the ongoing pattern, 15 songs had been recorded: Two singles A-sides (Devil in Disguise and the planned, but ultimately unissued single Memphis, Tennessee), an immediate B-side for 'Devil' (Please Don't Drag That String Around), and a twelve-track LP deftly mixing pop, rock, love ballads, and hints of Elvis' blues and country roots.  Some 60 years down the line, it still adds up to a wonderfully eclectic collection from the guy who once said, ""I sing all kinds,"" and he was neither boasting nor kidding.  Four shining stars and definitely recommended.",M
"Import version, basically the same as the domestic release but featuring a better cover (imho).  Released originally to accompany / capitalize on the release of his autobiography. And in that sense, it's all good, I suppose, although this material has been collected and re-collected numerous times. But if you're looking to have just one Eric Clapton retrospective in your collection, this just may be the one for you.  Disc One covers the various group and early solo years.  Disc Two centers in on the Warner Brothers releases.  And not surprisingly, the first disc is the really interesting one for classic rockers.  The second cd has a lot of big singles and radio hits; for the most part, however, they're not as strong as the savage young Eric.  Five stars for the casual fan, four stars for the rest of us.  Definitely recommended.",B
"Daylight Again began as a duo project for Stephen Stills and Graham Nash, as David Crosby was in the throes of his legendary and debilitating drug addiction.  Atlantic Records passed on the duo concept and suggested that Stills and Nash should somehow work Croz into the project.  It was the group's last best hope.  Sales for the CSN trio's third LP together would surely outpace a SN duo release.  They did, and it did, and all was well, for a while anyway.  The album produced a pair of genuine hit singles (Nash's Wasted on the Way, Stills' Southern Cross) that pushed it up into the top ten charts and on to platinum sales certification.  The Cali soft-rock sound that stoked the album was right in the pocket for the times, and the Crosby contributions (Delta, Might as Well Have a Good Time) felt right in the mix, never mind that Art Garfunkel and Timothy B. Schmidt were all over the vocal harmonies throughout the project.  It was the last time an original CSN collection would be so well received.  Four stars from me and highly recommended.",c
"What would the Band be like without Robbie Robertson?  People wanted to know back in the early '80s.  Well, if Live in Tokyo 1983 is any indication, they'd have been a kick-butt Americana outfit that still had a whole lotta life left in them.  Playing with the Cate Brothers Band, the Band mixed classic rock covers alongside familiar J.R. Robertson written favorites to create a wildly entertaining setlist that aimed to -- and succeeded at -- pleasing their decades long followers.  Levon Helm, Richard Manuel, Garth Hudson, Rick Danko.  They never rested on their laurels; along with the Cate Brothers, they give it their all.  If you can find this two-disc set at a reasonable price, and you were ever a big Band fan, don't hesitate.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.",B
"The follow-up to his ""The Street Was Always There"" collection, and basically, it's more of the same.  A journeyman's collection of folk and folk-rock covers (mostly) delivered in Andersen's smooth, thoughtful style.  If you were a fan of 'Street,' then ""Waves"" will be right in your wheelhouse.  Three-and-one-half stars and a mildly enthusiastic recommendation from this longtime fan.  I much prefer him in singer / songwriter mode rather than as an interpreter of other writers' works.",K
"Eddie and David Brigati's lost masterpiece.  Why hasn't this classic Rascals side-bar story been reissued on CD?  It's easily the equal of ""Felix Cavaliere"" / ""Destiny,"" and far outshines ""Treasure."" That something as good as this remains unattainable in today's music marketplace is positively mindboggling.  I bought the LP back in 1976 (and I still own and play it!) after hearing the title track played by the late, great Scott ""Scotso"" Muni on the late, lamented WNEW-FM 102.7, where rock lived in those days.  While it was the title track that drew me in at first, the entire album grabbed hold of my musical soul and has never let go -- some 46 years on.  It's that good, yes!  C'mon, Rhino, this one's right in your Rascals lovin' wheelhouse.  Make ""Lost in The Wilderness"" available for people to fall in love with again -- or for the very first time.  Thanks for all the great music, Eddie & Dave, I highly recommend this one to everyone who loves music made with genuine care and feeling.  Prepare to be moved!",s
"Another Chicago retrospective, this time an import.  Trouble is the same as ever.  The Columbia recordings far outshine the Warners years, leaving their '80s output seeming incredibly limp and middle-of-the-road.  Once they were an adventurous and risk-taking creative juggernaut embraced by both the AM-radio singles market and the FM-classic rock format.  By the '80s, however,  Chicago had devolved into an Adult Contemporary radio power ballad machine, becoming bland, less significant, and ever more meaningless with each new release.  Compilations such as this one drive that sad fact home all too often.  Three stars for the Columbia output featured.  Minus two stars for the mindless power ballad inclusions.",K
"As a rule I tend to really enjoy covers discs.  Not this go 'round.  Does neither Tom Petty nor Lucinda Williams justice.  A good idea on paper, maybe, but poorly executed.  Sorry, but this completely misses Petty's much loved, much missed rock 'n' roll heart.  Recommended for diehard Lu fans.  Most Petty fans, like me, will find it lacking.",m
"This three-disc import mini-box makes the near-perfect companion to the two-disc ""The Fever The Remastered Epic Recordings"" compilation (2017).  Following hot on the heels of the band's masterwork (1978's ""Hearts of Stone""), the first Mercury album (""The Jukes"") may have seemed kind of hit-and-miss upon release, but it opens on a high note with a pair of near-classics (All I Want is Everything, I'm So Anxious) and closes with a stirring standout (Vertigo); the songwriting (mostly by Billy Rush) is never less than interesting.  The follow-up (""Love Is a Sacrifice"") upped the ante even further with the emergence of Rush and Southside (John Lyon) as production partners.  In addition to the classic title track, the album contains what would become live Jukes concert staples (Love When It's Strong, Restless Heart, On the Beach), as well as the band's most beautiful, if heart-wrenching ballad (It Hurts).  The third and final Mercury release (""Reach Up And Touch The Sky"") was originally a two-LP live set.  Here, it's all on one disc and it still kills: Hits, misses, and covers, all pushed along by Southside's vocals, the great core band, and those hot Jukes horns, 'til everyone goes home sweaty, smiling and happy.  The original outer LP artwork is replicated for each of the three discs, with the rest contained within the mini-box's booklet, along with credits, Malcolm Dome's interesting and informative notes, and single picture sleeve replicas.  The Mercury Years is a must-have for long-time Jukes fans ... like yours truly.",H
"A fun listen!  Although out of date and overpriced on Amazon, really enjoyed Travolta's singing and many of the lyrics were interesting and useful.  Road to Freedom and Way to Happiness were quite useful to me.  Music a bit out dated, would love to hear it rerecorded.  Recommended.",T

"This is a remarkable book filled with great moments showing how God uses His strength and power for our welfare and to further His divine purpose.I enjoyed the honesty, integrity, fortitude, he showed in his response to life circumstances. Dr. Stanley’s young life, upbringing, dreams, goals, and aspirations are also nicely highlighted. I appreciate how He interacts with others, those standing with him, and those who choose to go against him.Life was not sweet or kind every day, so we see Dr. Stanley develop strength, grit, and determination.Life kept knocking him down, as a child and tried again later in his life, so we see him learn to stand his ground, lean on God, listen for inspired directions, and stand firm in His faith.Dr. Stanley comes off as a interesting man, with a true and strong heart for God. This is a soothing and moving book to read. This book has lots of great examples of how to walk an enlightened path of faith, and it is A book that I highly recommend.",O

"This is a two-disc set that contains bonus tracks. Refer to my comment to this review for tracks.DISC ONE:  The musicians on the first four tracks were not aware that the tape was rolling and this was never intended to be anything more than a memento of the party. However,it was released as an album on September 28, 1973.The first four tracks of the Miles Davis set were recorded live at the Persian Room in the Plaza Hotel in NYC on September 9, 1958. The sextet features Davis on trumpet, Cannonball Adderley on alto sax, John Coltrane on tenor sax, and a rhythm section led by Bill Evans on piano, Paul Chambers on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums. This is about six months before the same sextet recorded Kind of Blue.Tracks 5 through 7 were recorded at the Spotlight Lounge in Washington D.C. on November 1, 1958, and the remaining tracks on this disc were recorded Birdland in NYC on January 3, 1959. On all of these bonus tracks Red Garland replaces Evans on piano.DISC TWO: Tracks 1 through 7 were on the original album and also recorded at the Persian Room in the Plaza Hotel in NYC on September 9, 1958. It features Ellington's orchestra that was comprised of Clark Terry, Shorty Baker and Cat Anderson on trumpet, Ray Nance on trumpet and violin, Quentin Jackson, Britt Woodman and John Sanders on trombone, Jimmy Hamilton on clarinet and tenor sax, Russell Procope on alto sax and clarinet, Johnny Hodges on alto sax, Paul Gonsalves on tenor sax, and Harry Carney on baritone sax, bass clarinet and clarinet. The rhythm setion is led by Ellington on piano, Jimmy Woode on bass and Sam Woodyard on drums.Track 5 features Jimmy Rushing on vocals, and track 6 features Billie Holiday on vocals backed by non-Ellington personnel Buck Clayton on trumpet, Mal Waldron on piano and unidentified bassist and drummer.Tracks 8 through 13 feature the main Ellington Orchestra (minus Rushing) and was recorded live at Salle Pleyel, Paris, France on November 20, 1958.",W
"Like the first collaboration between Evans and Manne on the 1962 album titled Empathy, this album has a completely different feel from Evans' other work. Most of the album is uptempo, and while harmony is still Evans' focus, melody and rhythm are given equal attention. I am sure that much of this is due to Shelly Manne's approach to drums, which is always creative), and Eddie Gomez' bass.The sound samples on this page convey the music far better than I can in words, so let those be your guide. I will say that if you are a drummer this is definitely an album you want to dissect. Same for bassists. Gomez is right up there with Scott LaFaro in my opinion. Not a clone, by any means, but still an excellent fit to Evans' playing (which is reinforced by future albums they would do together). Evans is legendary for giving his rhythm section space to stretch and this album is no exception. The breaks and solos by both Manne and Gomez are masterful.This album was recorded for Verve in a single October 4, 1966 session at Rudy van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs, NJ studio. According to some sources (including the liner notes on the LP) there were multiple takes, so the session was probably a trying day. However, each track sounds like spontaneous, effortless art to my ears, so whoever did the post production must have added a lot to the album too.",F
"At a mere twenty-seven minutes this album is brief. However, every note counts. At the time of this review the album seems to be credited to drummer Philly Joe Jones. It's the brainchild of Elmo Hope. In fact, each of the six songs are Hope's compositions:A1 Hot Sauce 3:35A2 When The Groove Is Low 4:58A3 De-Dah 4:26B1 Abdula 3:42B2 Freffie 3:36B3 Stars Over Marakesh 6:43If you are unfamiliar with Hope's work you are in for a treat. For one thing, despite being classified as a bebop pianist, he is nothing like Bud Powell, Al Haig, Monk, Dodo Marmarosa, etc. Actually, he is closer to Marmarosa than the others mentioned. Moreover, he spent a lot of time in both the NYC and Los Angeles scenes, so he absorbed both styles. Finally, there is a heavy touch of blues, as well as classical in his playing.He is backed on this album by Paul Chambers on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums. Both are perfect for the arrangements and compositions on the album. I am very familiar with Chambers (especially his work with Red Garland), and am greatly influenced by Jones.This was recorded for the Celebrity label in NYC in 1961. I was unable to nail down an exact date or studio. I suspect that this was recorded in a single session since many albums (and especially ones as short as this one) were one day affairs. I would appreciate any additional information, which you can place in a comment.",W
"This is another of my vinyl treasures because it features Waldron solo. Another big plus is the sound quality is far better than I expected considering my LP is in Good to VG condition. Every note is crystal clear. This is especially impressive considering that this was recorded live.There are only four tracks, but the album still clocks in at a respectable 37:08. Granted, the LP could have held more, but I am not complaining because this is the only recording I own of Waldron solo.Since there is no track list, I am including it here: A1 Mingus Lives 7:48A2 Snake Out 10:42B1 Tensile Structure 7:54B2 Here, There and Everywhere 10:44The entire album is comprised of Waldron compositions. This is the second tribute album he recorded for former bandleaders. The first was Blues for Lady Day (also solo) in 1972 and this one. This was recorded for the Enja label at the Chapati Club in Spa, Belgium on February 28, 1979.",E
"This is not an essential album, but does have some excellent arrangements thanks to Roger Neumann's tenor and soprano sax, and flute. His addition to the ensemble adds an extra dimension to Anita's vocals over and above her typical jazz piano trio backing.Ao vivo means live in Portuguese; this album was recorded live for the Estudio Eldorado label at the 150 Night Club located in the Maksoud Plaza Hotel in São Paulo, Brazil on August 21 and 22, 1984. Anita's voice on this album is still in good form, and her vocals are delivered with her trademark rhythmic intensity. The sound quality is above average.In addition to Neumann she is backed by Harold Danko on piano, Rick Laird on bass and longtime collaborator John Poole on drums. They are tight and back her perfectly. Here are the tracks:A1  Wave  3:36A2  It Had To Be You  3:44A3  Sleeping Bee  3:38A4  Time After Time  4:30A5  Stomping At The Savoy  4:26A6  P-Town  0:48B1  The Man With The Horn  3:28B2  Body And Soul  6:04B3  Lush Life  3:44B4  The Song Is You  3:49B5  Wave  2:01This isn't what I would consider an essential album, but for we fans the recording quality and performances make it a worthwhile buy.",d
"Up front, a good copy of this album in vinyl has excellent sound quality, but I want to disclose that to my ears the arrangements are a little too heavy and a little too busy. I am not going to subtract a star because of it because the musicianship is superb and my personal taste should not enter into the equation.There are some redeeming moments in this album. Specifically, everything that Previn plays is beyond reproach and I think that is something to which any listener would agree.  I also loved Bud Shank's flute work on the tracks on which he played that instrument. In fact, the entire wind section (Shank on alto and flute, Jimmy Giuffre on baritone, and Bob Cooper on tenor and soprano) are uniformly excellent throughout. Milt Bernhart's trombone and Shorty Rogers' trumpet were well played, but I think the trombone in particular was a too low for the arrangements, and Rogers was a bit on the busy side.Shelly Manne is the drummer on all tracks, but the bassists are Joe Mondragon ( tracks A1-A3, A5, B1-B3 and B5), with Curtis Counce on the remaining tracks. Jack Marshall is on guitar on tracks A1 and A2, and B1 and B2, with Al Hendrickson on the remaining tracks.The tracks on this album that clocks in at 35:14 are:A1  It's DelovelyA2  PorterhouseA3  Heat WaveA4  40° BelowA5  You Stepped Out Of A DreamA6  ClaudiaB1  You Do Something To MeB2  Call For ColeB3  Everything I've GotB4  Some AnticsB5  It Only Happens When I Dance With YouB6  General ClusterPrevin is the composer for tracks A2, A4 and A6, with Rogers getting composer credits for tracks B2, B4 and B6. The remaining tracks are standards by the usual suspects (Porter, Berlin, Hart, Rogers, Kahn et al.) This album was recorded for RCA Victor at over the course of three sessions at their Los Angeles studios in 1954: March 30 (tracks 3, 5, 9 and 11), June 14 (tracks 4, 6, 10 and 12), and September 14, (tracks 1, 2, 7 and 8.)",O
"This is one of my thrift shop finds (the vinyl was in pristine condition!) This album proves beyond a doubt that Previn's jazz chops are considerable. All songs are penned by Loewe & Lerner, but it's the way Previn arranged them for a jazz piano trio that is a mark of his genius (as well as his and his rhythm sections performance.) There are places where you can hear Ahmad Jamal's influence. Indeed, at one point on A3 (A Toujours) the trio sounded like the Jamal/Crosby/Fournier line-up from their Pershing album. In other tracks it's pure Previn with both Manne's and Mitchell's signature styles.Since there is no track list as I write this, there is what comprises the 38:54 minutes on the album:A1  The Parisians  4:32A2  I Remember I Will  4:30A3  A Toujours  5:38A4  It's A Bore  4:18B1  Aunt Alicia's March  5:01B2  Thank Heaven For Little Girls  4:31B3  Gigi  5:39B4  She Is Not Thinking Of Me  4:09As a drummer the stand out for me is Shelly Manne's brushwork, but I also love Red Mitchell's bass, and, of course, Previn's approach to piano (and arranging). The trio is tight and the way they are all three locked in, yet all three participating, make this as instructive as it is enjoyable.This was recorded for the Contemporary label in their Los Angeles studios on April 7 and 8, 1958.  This is West Coast jazz at its best, and a showcase for Previn's versatility.",Q
"I received these as a free review sample. Before you read my observations take the time to check out  Tom's very thorough and helpful video review dated April 5, 2016.These are far better suited to home use than camping in my opinion for a number of reasons. Foremost (and why I subtracted a star) is they are not easy to start, even with a lighter, and secondary, they are heavy. For campers a box of these is extremely heavy (for camping) and add almost nine pounds to carrying weight.For starting fire places, wood stoves and grills and even charcoal grills these are excellent. More importantly, these work beautifully in hibachi style grills and they do last the claimed amount of time.Despite my caveat about these being less than optimal for camping, one or two in a backpack are a good hedge against an emergency. Just be prepared to first build a kindling fire and build on that before lighting one of these pucks because you are not going to directly get one started with a firestick.",W
"This album is yet another of my thrift shop finds. The mystery is on the cover it's credited as Piano Solos With Instrumental Accompaniment. I took that as a challenge because there were no hints in the liner notes as to who was backing him. I pretty much suspected Red Mitchell on bass and Shelly Manne on drums, but beyond that had no clue. I managed to track down the dates and personnel on each track, which I will provide below.First, you can listen to the tracks on a larger compilation made up of albums and tracks from the same era: [[ASIN:B008FTAH2O Previn's Touch]]. Run through the sound samples and you will be treated to a display of Previn's jazz chops. Although he had the touch and feel for classical, and the innate sensibility for sound tracks and scores, he was a first rate jazz musician, but his other work (and the fact that he was in the West Coast scene) overshadowed that. This album is evidence that he was the real thing in jazz too.Here is the track list, which is missing at the time I am writing this:A1  Flying Down To Rio  2:30A2  You Are Too Beautiful  3:19A3  When You Wish Upon A Star  2:05A4  London In July  3:25A5  Moonlight In Vermont  3:18A6  Island In The West Indies  3:29B1  How Are Things In Glocca Morra  3:43B2  It Could Happen To You  3:03B3  Honolulu  2:51B4  My Foolish Heart  2:11B5  But Beautiful  3:11B6  Sidewalks Of Cuba  2:24It took some sleuthing to discover who was backing him. All of the tracks were recorded for the Decca label in Los Angeles in April 1955 and March 1956. Here are the sessions and musicians in chronological order:April 1955 has Previn backed by Al Hendrickson on guitar, Red Mitchell on bass and Irv Cottler on drums:Track B1: April 11.Tracks A1,A4 and A6: April 13.Tracks A5, B3 and B6: April 18.March 1956 has Previn backed by Al Hendrickson on guitar, Carson Smith on bass and Shelly Manne on drums:Tracks B2 and B5: March 28.Tracks A2, A3 and B4: March 29.This album was released by Decca as DL 74350 in 1963 and clocks in at 35:35. If you are a pianist or a West Coast jazz fan this is a great album.",D
"This is yet another of my thrift shop finds. What caught my eye is this album contains the iconic track that was captured on video by Bert Stern, [[ASIN:B00003OSU4 Jazz on a Summer's Day]], which is track A4 on this LP. Since the tracks are not listed at the time I am writing this, here they are:A1 Lover Come Back To Me 2:16A2 Back Water Blues 4:33A3 Crazy Love 3:27A4 All Of Me 5:18B1 Backstage Blues 9:10B2 Julie And Jake 8:40The entire album was recorded live at the Newport Jazz Festival on July 6, 1958. All of Side A features Dinah Washington, but Side B contains only instrumentals. The first three tracks of Side A are: Dinah Washington backed by Blue Mitchell on trumpet, Melba Liston on trombone (and arranger), Harold Ousley on tenor sax and Sahib Shibab on baritone sax. The rhythm section is Wynton Kelly on piano, Paul West on bass and Max Roach on drums.Track A4 is a change up with Washington backed by Don Elliott on mellophone, Urbie Green on trombone, Terry Gibbs (and briefly Washington) on vibraphone, with the same rhythm section.Side B is Don Elliott on mellophone, Urbie Green on trombone, Terry Gibbs on vibraphone and the same rhythm section as Side A.",J
"Up front: the sound quality is acceptable, but not up to audiophile standards. I have no complaints, but if you are a discriminating listener with a lot of money in audio gear you may want to look elsewhere.Nine of the ten discs span the period between 1952 and 1959, with one disc from 1981, the year before Art passed. It's difficult to pick a favorite disc, and that is subjective anyway. What I'll do is list the number of tracks on each, when and where the tracks were recorded, and on as many as I can, the musicians on the tracks.Also note that each disc sleeve has a title as well. Those titles do not map to specific albums, although it's easy to extrapolate some albums from which the tracks came by noting the dates, personnel and tracks. I'll list each track in a comment to this review.DISC ONE: 11 tracks.Sleeve title is Diablo's Dance. Recorded in 1957 in Los Angeles. Appears to be Art on tenor, with Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums from the sessions that produced Art Pepper Meets The Rhythm Section.DISC TWO. 11 tracks.Sleeve title is Long Ago and Far Away. Recorded in 1956 and 1957 in Los Angeles. Personnel include the following ensembles backing Art:Carl Perkins (piano), Ben Tucker (bass) and Chuck Flores (drums)Russ Freeman (piano), Ben Tucker (bass) and Chuck Flores (drums)Russ Freeman (piano), Leroy Vinnegar (bass) and Shelly Manne (drums)Gerry Wiggins (piano), Red Norvo (vibraphone), Ben Tucker (bass) and Joe Morello (drums)DISC THREE. 12 tracks.Sleeve title is Angel's Wings. Recorded in Los Angeles in 1956 and 1957. Personnel include the following ensembles backing Art:Russ Freeman (piano), Jack Sheldon (trumpet), Leroy Vinnegar (bass) and Shelly Manne (drums)Russ Freeman (piano), Ben Tucker (bass) and Chuck Flores (drums)Gerry Wiggins (piano), Red Norvo (vibraphone), Ben Tucker (bass) and Joe Morello (drums)Carl Perkins (piano), Ben Tucker (bass) and Chuck Flores (drums)DISC FOUR. 13 tracks.Sleeve title is Blues In. Recorded in Los Angeles between 1952 and 1957. Unable to track down the backing musicians.DISC FIVE. 10 tracks.Sleeve title is Pepper Blues. Recorded in Los Angeles between 1952 and 1957. Backing musicians are:Red Garland (piano), Paul Chambers (bass) and Philly Joe Jones (drums)Hampton Hawes (piano), Joe Mondragon (bass) and Larry Bunker (drums and vibraphone)DISC SIX. 4 tracks.Sleeve title is Road Waltz. Recorded in Los Angeles in 1981 (a year before Art's passing). George Cables (piano), David Williams (bass) and Carl Burnett (drums). Art is on clarinet on When You're Smiling.DISC SEVEN. 10 tracks.Sleeve title is Art Pepper Big Band. Recorded in Los Angeles in 1959. Unable to track down the backing musicians.DISC EIGHT. 9 tracks.Sleeve title is Art Pepper & Marty Paich Quartet. This disc is identical to The Marty Paich Quartet Featuring Art Pepper, which was recorded in Los Angeles in 1956 and features Marty Paich on piano, Buddy Clark on bass and Frank Capp on drums backing Art on alto.DISC NINE. 12 tracks.Sleeve title is Spices. Recorded in Los Angeles in 1954 and features the following backing musicians:Jack Montrose (ténor), Claude Williamson (piano),; Monty Budwig (bass) and Paul Ballerina (drums)Hampton Hawes (piano), Joe Mondragon (bass) and Larry Bunker (drums)Jack Montrose (ténor), Claude Williamson (piano), Monty Budwig (bass) and Larry Bunker (drums)DISC TEN. 12 tracks.Sleeve title is With Mel Torme & Marty Paich Quartet. Recorded in Los Angeles in 1959. Some featured musicians include Jack Shelton on trumpet, Victor Feldman on vibraphone, Marty Piach on piano and Mel Torme on vocals.To me this set is a valuable collection of one of the most lyrical alto saxophonists in jazz. Art is among my top three favorite alto players - the other two are Johnny Hodges and Paul Desmond. Please see the comment below for the complete track list, which will give clues about the albums and recording sessions from which they came.",x
"This gem is one of my thrift shop finds. It's based on a 1959 Broadway musical that enjoyed 452 performances at the 46th Street Theatre. The music on this album mimics the play in that it's relatively obscure, but enjoyable. This album is from an era when soundtracks from plays and musicals were very popular.This one has a slight Dixieland feel to it, and because it is performed by a sextet instead of a full orchestra is interestingly arranged. When researching this album an interesting (but unverified) tidbit surfaced: the ensemble did not rehearse - they walked into the studio and 'had fun' creating the tracks that were selected for this album from among the eighteen that were actually performed in acts I and II in the play itself. Here are the tracks on this album and their lengths. The entire album clocks in at 33:36:A1  My Girl Is Just Enough For Me  4:05A2  Just For Once  2:22A3  I Feel Mighty Marvelous  3:54A4  The Right Finger Of My Left Hand  2:27A5  Look Who's In Love  3:30B1  Uncle Sam Rag  3:52B2  Two Faces In The Dark  3:25B3  I'm Back In Circulation  2:45B4  Erbie Fitch's Dilemma  2:01B5  Pick Pocket Tango  4:15That's still almost two thirds of the actual songs from the play. All are catchy and nicely interpreted and performed. My favorite is B5, but I love songs with a tango feel. I cannot begin to describe the music since words are inadequate, but if you like more traditional jazz that is more easy listening and commercial, this is an interesting album and a fun listen.This was originally recorded for the Design Records label in 1959 and features Rex Stewart on trumpet backed by  John Bunch on piano, Joe Venuto on marimba, Leonard Gaskin on bass and Mousey Alexander on drums.",N
"This four album set comes on two discs and features Flanagan's first album as a leader, and the rest as either co-leader or sideman. The sound quality is very good. I have come to trust this label for putting together competently remastered sets of albums that are mostly out of print.The tracks are not in chronological order, but they are grouped by the source albums from which they are taken. Also, the albums are as originally issued. There may be re-releases that have bonus tracks, but this set does not.Disc One starts off with an album titled Jazz...It's Magic! that was recorded for the Regent label at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on September 5, 1957. It's credited as the Curtis Fuller-Tommy Flanagan Quintet and features Fuller on trombone and Sonny Redd on alto sax, backed by Flanagan on piano, George Tucker on bass and Louis Hayes on drums. The tracks are:1. Two Ton2. Medley (It's Magic/My One And Only/They Didn't Believe Me)3. Soul Station4. Club Car5. Upper BerthRemaining tracks are from the album titled The King and I that was recorded by the Wilbur Harden Quartet in NYC for the Savoy label on September 23 and 30, 1958. Hardin is on trumpet and flugelhorn backed by Flanagan on piano and celeste, George Duvivier on bass and Granville Hogan on drums. Tracks are:6.  Getting To Know You7.  My Lord And Master8.  Shall We Dance9.  We Kiss In A Shadow10. I Have Dreamed11. I Whistle A Happy Tune12. Hello Young Lovers13. Something Wonderful14: `Trio Overseas'14. Relaxin' At CamarilloDisc Two starts off Trio Overseas, which is Flanagan's first album as a leader. It  was recorded for the Metronome label in Stockholm, Sweden on August 15, 1957. Flanagan is backed by Wilbur Little on bass and Elvin Jones on drums. Tracks are:1. Chelsea Bridge2. Eclypso3. Beats Up4. Skal Brothers5. Little Rock6. Verdandi7. Dalarna8. Willow Weep For MeTracks 9 through 13 are the album titled The Cats that was recorded for the New Jazz and Prestige labels at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on April 18, 1957. This album is credited to the Prestige All Stars and features Flanagan as co-leader. The line-up is Idrees Sulieman on trumpet with John Coltrane on tenor sax, backed by Flanagan on piano, Kenny Burrell on guitar, Doug Watkins on bass and Louis Hayes on drums. Tracks are:9.  Minor Mishap10. How Long Has This Been Going On?11. Eclypso12. Solacium13. Tommy's Time",E
"This is the first of four collaborations between Peterson and Jackson and it presages the ones to come. At a few seconds short of forty one minutes this album is almost a tease.One of the nice things about this album is it has some of the restraint Jackson used with the Modern Jazz Quartet. However, Peterson's piano is a major contrast to John Lewis' of the MJQ and that contrast makes this album interesting. For one thing, Peterson and bassist Ray Brown were renown for intensity even on ballads, and drummer Ed Thigpen fit right into that as well.Despite my alluding to intensity, the music comes across as relaxed and laid back. They made it sound so easy! When you closely listen the intensity is there under a layer of virtuosity and musicality. This is Jackson and Peterson's trio at their finest in my opinion.Since there is no track list (as I write this) I am providing one for reference:1. On Green Dolphin Street 7:322. Heartstrings  5:433. Work Song 7:354. John Brown's Body 7:49 5. A Wonderful Guy 4:57 6. Reunion BluesThe album was recorded for Verve in NYC over the course of two sessions (September 15 and 18, 1961.)  Sadly there were five unissued tracks from the sessions, two of which are logged as 'untitled Peterson originals' that I would have loved to have been included in a reissue. Regardless, the music that is on this album is definitely worthwhile.",r
"This recording was made for the Belgium Philippe Defalle label in November 1979 in Brussles.I subtracted two stars because Baker's vocals are very weak here. His performances during this period were always hit or miss and this was must have caught him on a bad day. His trumpet work, though, does not suffer in the least. He is in full command of that instrument.There is no track list at the time of this review, so I am providing one and the times for each track:01. This is always  7:4902. Sweet Martine  8:2003. Beatrice  6:4904. Deep in a dream  5:5305. Once I loved  4:51The album itself is somewhat pensive, with a laid back feeling among the entire ensemble. The instrumental sections are tight as though rehearsed a few times. I am not sure that was actually the case, but that is one of the key strengths of this album and what makes it so enjoyable. There is a touch of Baker's good days in those parts of the album.Another interesting thing is this does not come across as a hastily thrown together session. The ensemble is fairly large for Baker during this era in his career. He is accompanied by Steve Houben on alto sax, and backed by a solid rhythm section comprised of  Dennis Luxion on piano (credited as Denis Luxion) Bill Frisell on guitar, Kermit Driscoll on bass and Bruno Castellucci on drums. In particuar Houben, Luxion and Frisell stand out,  while Driscoll and Castellucci are solid on pulse and time. No complaints with any member of the ensemble or the sound quality of this CD.",R
"This is actually a studio album that was put together by Granz as a recorded (and supervised) jam. The line-up is first rate, and has a large alto and tenor saxophone section, fronted by Charlie Shavers on trumpet and backed by a solid rhythm section.Basically, this is along the lines with one of Granz' Jazz At The Philharmonic sessions. Here are the tracks:A Jam Blues 14:39B Ballad Medley 17:21C What Is This Thing Called Love 15:48D Funky Blues 13:26A and B are LP #1 and C and D are the second LP. If you find this set in VG condition the sound quality is superb. As can be seen from the track times each song is an extended rendition of a standard, with the obligatory ballad medley. Funky Blues is a Johnny Hodges composition, and the Ballad Medley is comprised of the following: All The Things You Are, Dearly Beloved, The Nearness Of You, I'll Get By, Everything Happens To Me, The Man I Love, What's New?, Someone To Watch Over Me and Isn't It Romantic?The line-up is a front line featuring Charlie Shavers on trumpet, accompanied by an alto sax section comprised of Johnny Hodges, Charlie Parker and Benny Carter, and a tenor sax section comprised of Flip Phillips and Ben Webster. The rhythm section was led by the Oscar Peterson Trio (Peterson on piano,  Barney Kessel on guitar and Ray Brown on bass), and J. C. Heard on drums.This album was originally released on both Mercury and Clef, then by Verve. It was recorded at Radio Recorders in Los Angeles on June 17, 1952 (some discographies cite July 1952.If you are familiar with JATP sessions from this era you already have an idea how this will sound. To my ears it's a fantastic reminder that folks were making some great music sixty-three years ago.",w
"This is a great two album set with two additional tracks from a third album. The interesting thing is tracks 13 through 18 are Burrell's first album as a leader, and the first twelve tracks feature him on vocals as well as guitar.Since there is no track list as I write this I am providing it for reference:1.  I'll Buy You A Star2.  Weaver Of Dreams3.  The More I See You4.  I'm Just A Lucky So And So5.  A Fine Romance6.  Until The Real Thing Comes Along7.  The Blues Is Awful Mean8.  That Old Feeling9.  If I Had You10. Hootchie-Koo11. Afternoon In Paris12. Like Someone In Love13. This Time The Dream's On Me14. Fugue'n Blues15. Takeela16. Weaver Of Dreams17. Delilah18. Blues For Skeeter19. Get Happy20. But Not For MeThe music is what you would expect from Burrell who was a veteran player when his inaugural album was recorded in 1956. He is backed by some of the best NYC musicians of the era, and that, too, indicates the high standard of music on this album. Add in the fact that the sound quality is superb for a CD and this album is a winner all around.Tracks 1 through 12 were recorded for Columbia in NYC in four different sessions between October 18, 1960 and April 11, 1961. These tracks feature Burrell on both guitar and vocals. He has a similar singing voice to Nat King Cole who I am guessing inspired him. It's a pity Burrell didn't sing more on other albums because his voice is excellent.Tracks 1, 2 and 9 were recorded on March 1, 1961 with Burrell accompanied by Bobby Jasper on tenor sax and backed by  Tommy Flanagan on piano, Wendell Marshall on bass and Bobby Donaldson on drums.Tracks 3, 4, 7 and 12 were recorded on November 1, 1960 with the same line-up with a few changes on specific tracks. On track 7 Joe Benjamin is on bass and Bill English is on drums.Tracks 5, 6 and 8 were recorded on October 18, 1960 with Burrell accompanied by Bobby Jasper on tenor sax and flute, and backed by Wendell Marshall on bass and Bobby Donaldson on drums.Tracks 10 and 11 were recorded on April 11, 1961 with Burrell accompanied by Bobby Jasper on tenor sax and backed by a rhythm section comprised of Tommy Flanagan on  piano, Joe Benjamin on bass and Bill English on drums.Tracks 13 through 18 are the album titled [[ASIN:B004ADWXTY Introducing Kenny Burrell]] that was recorded on May 29 and 30, 1956 for Blue Note at Rudy Van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio. Kenny's guitar is backed by Tommy Flanagan on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, Kenny Clarke on drums and Candido Camero on congas.Tracks 19 and 20 are from the album titled Kenny Burrell, Vol. 2, which was a follow-on to Introducing Kenny Burrell. These two tracks were recorded during the same May 29 and 30 1956 sessions with the same line up on track 19. He is solo on track 20.",r
"This album has a WWI theme because the song selection was chosen for their popularity during the 19-teens. Many of the songs are timeless, like track 1, After You've Gone. Others have fallen into obscurity, but when this album was recorded in 1957 many were still in the public's mind since WWI ended less than forty years prior. Note that the last track, Vamp's Blues, was written by Charlie Mariano who was not born until after the war (in 1923). Still, the overall theme of this album, with a distinct West Coast flavor, is what drew me to it.Since there is no track list on this page (at the time of this review) I am including it here:1.  After You've Gone 4:492.  When Johnny Comes Marching Home 5:133.  Deep River 5:404.  Till We Meet Again  4:155.  K-K-K-Katy 5:276.  'til The Clouds Roll By 2:397.  Over There  4:228.  Ja Da 4:179.  Hello, Central, Give Me No Man's Land  3:5710. Vamp's Blues  7:05The entire album clocks in at 48:14 and you can listen to sound samples on a reissue of this album at [[ASIN:B008C7POJ0 The Vamp's Blues]]. Let those guide you because they convey a lot more about this album than I can possibly put into words.This was recorded in Los Angeles for the World Pacific label at the Radio Recorders studio on December 10 and 11, 1957. Charlie Mariano is on alto sax (and recorder on Deep River), Jerry Dodgion is on alto sax and flute, Victor Feldman is on vibraphone, Jimmy Rowles on piano, Monty Budwig on bass and Shelly Manne on drums.",U
"I discovered this album in near pristine condition at a local thrift shop and it was love at first listen. I have been both an avid Paul Desmond and Modern Jazz Quartet for for decades. While members of the MJQ often were on other albums (both bassist Percy Heath and drummer Connie Kay were on Desmond-led albums), and Milt Jackson was prolific as a sideman with other groups they were a closed unit. Being invited to site in was a signal honor for Desmond, and that they were musically on the same page is evident when listening to this album.Sadly there are no sound samples on this page, although of you scour the web you will find some of the tracks from this album. Desmond's slow, dynamically soft playing is a perfect fit. I am especially impressed with John Lewis on piano and Jackson on vibraphone who seemed to be connected to Desmond on a one of those rare levels that we musicians experience. The rhythm section is absolutely perfect here. This is a major contrast to the Dave Brubeck Quartet rhythm section, which was Desmond's home for nearly twenty years.Also missing from this page is the track listing. I am including it and track times so you know what this album contains:SIDE AA1 Greensleeves 3:10A2 You Go To My Head 7:56A3 Blue Dove/La Paloma Azul 4:55A4 Jesus Christ Superstar 4:54SIDE BB1 Here's That Rainy Day 4:50B2 East Of The Sun 8:25B3 Bags New Groove 5:10Think of this as the MJQ with a special guest (which, of course it is), because John Lewis holds the reins tightly on this live album. However, in this case he did not have to rein in Desmond who was so perfectly suited to the MJQ that one has to wonder why there is only a single collaboration between him and the entire quartet. This is definitely an album to own!",\
"This album is parts of two separate radio broadcasts - one from the Basin Street East in NYC and the other from the Blue Note Club in Chicago.  The sound quality is surprisingly good considering all of the tracks are live and in a live setting. The announcements either add to the ambiance or wreck the album, depending on your point of view. For me I actually like them. You may have other thoughts, but at least you know that a lot of the broadcast has not been edited out.Since there is no track list at the time of this review I am providing one:1.  Theme (The Duke) & Introduction2.  Stardust3.  Gone With The Wind4.  Stompin' for Mili5.  Out of Nowhere (Incomplete)6.  A Minor Thing7.  In Your Own Sweet Way8.  The Trolley Song9.  Introduction & The Duke10. Love Walked In11. Here Lies Love12. All the Things You Are13. Theme (The Duke) And Introduction14. I'm In A Dancing Mood15. The Song Is YouTracks 1 through 12 - the bulk of this album - are from the February 1956 engagement(s) at the Basin Street East. I am not sure of the date or dates and each discography I have checked does not provide exact details. The line-up is the one before the classic Wright/Morello rhythm section joined the quartet. This one has Dave Brubeck on piano, Paul Desmond on alto sax, Norman Bates on bass and Joe Dodge on drums.The last three tracks are from the March 1957 engagement at the Blue Note Club. Joe Morello had replaced Joe Dodge by the time these tracks were recorded and may, in fact, be the first recorded tracks with the Quartet featuring Joe Morello.Some of the tracks on this album are on other live compilations, but not all of them. Frankly this is not what I would consider an essential album, but it is definitely worth it if you are a fan.",V
"This album shares a lot with [[ASIN:B000CCB1PE Keyboard]] because it features Peterson in a duo with a bassist (two, in fact, with both Major Holley and Ray Brown swapping depending on the track). Also, some of the tracks for both albums were recorded during the same session.Since there is no track list at the time of this review I am providing what the CD contains:1.  Debut 2:522.  They Didn't Believe Me 2:553.  Lover, Come Back to Me 2:514.  Where or When  3:275.  Three O'Clock in the Morning  3:396.  All the Things You Are  3:367.  Tenderly  3:468.  Oscar's Blues  3:149.  Little White Lies  3:0910. In the Middle of a Kiss  3:1311. Nameless  2:5512. Two Sleepy People  3:18Total play time is a little over 40 minutes, which was long for 1950 when this album was recorded. Although there are no sound samples, each track sounds like Peterson solo with the underpinnings of bass. When I first listened I though he was solo and playing some remarkable stuff with his left hand. Given his prowess that is not a stretch, but on the first eight tracks the bass is Ray Brown and on the remaining four it's Major Holley. The Peterson/Brown tracks were recorded in NYC for the Clef label during March 1950. I was never able to track down specific dates, but it does place the session a year or so away from Peterson's first trio featuring Brown on bass and Herb Ellis on guitar. The last four tracks were recorded on May 8, 1950 in NYC during the same session that produced Keyboard mentioned above.The mastering on this CD is excellent and audiophile quality. If you are willing to go budget this album is also available in a budget-priced, ten disc set titled [[ASIN:B00KBZ74O4 Oscar Peterson & Friends]]. The sound quality of that one is good, but nowhere near the quality of this CD.",p
"I love this album mainly for the collaboration between Milt Jackson and Miles, but I have to give due credit to McLean's contributions too. Not only is his playing masterful, but Dr. Jackle and Minor March are his compositions. Ray Bryant contributed a composition as well: Changes. The remaining track is a Thad Jones composition that somehow got slipped into the track list.At the time of this review there is no track list on this product page, The album clocks in a scant 31 minutes with the following four tracks:01 Dr. Jackle02 Bitty Ditty03 Minor March04 ChangesRay Bryant is another reason why I love this album. I own a large number of his albums and his playing here does not disappoint. Credit is also due Percy Heath on bass and Art Taylor on drums, both of whom make definite contributions by staying under the music and supporting it. Taylor is one of my favorite drummers from that era simply because he could play any groove and do so unobtrusively. He manages the same here and is locked in with Heath to give the melody instruments a foundation.The album was recorded in a single session at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on August 5, 1955 and released the next year by Prestige as PRLP 7034. Some accounts of this session claim Miles' was disgusted with McLean for being high, but that is not evident in the playing.",V
"This album was recorded on January 24, 1980 for the Ornament label in Aachen, Germany (according to notes I researched it was in the home of Friedrich and Gabi Klemme.) The sound quality is a little on the muddy side and the snippets of 'crowd' noise that creep into the recording indicate that this was either a party or a private recital with possibly a dozen or more folks in attendance.The music is what counts and in my growing collection of Donegan recordings that is one thing that never disappoints. Here she is backed by George Linges on bass and Tony Mann on drums. While the title implies a slant towards Ellington, the only tribute to the Duke is the title track. Otherwise, it's a collection of mainly recognizable standards including two medleys that give Donegan room to show her amazing improvisational skills. She can do the seemingly impossible going from one song to the next, often quoting even more songs within the melody.Since there is no track list at the time of this review I am providing it:1. Jumpin' at the Woodside2. Medley: In the Mood/Mack the Knife3. Medley: Sophisticated Lady/Dorothy's Themes4. Smile5. September in the Rain6. Medley: Send in the Clowns/Jesse/You'll Never Walk Alone/If I Loved You/My wayThe album clocks in at 49:41, so there is a decent amount of music. I would not call this 'essential', but if you are a fan it's certainly worth grabbing. If you are a stickler for sound quality, though, you may want to pass this one up.",U
"Most of the tracks on this compilation were recorded in 1947 with Marmarosa as leader. The exception being is six tracks from a 1946 Lucky Thompson album called out below. Marmarosa is in excellent form on every track and if you are a pianist interested in this era of music (heavy bebop influence with his unique approach to the instrument) this set is a treasure trove.Sadly there are no sound samples on this page at the time of this review. Nor is there a track listing. I am going to provide the tracks and their sources, but they will be a little out of order because I am also going to include personnel, locations and other pertinent information to help you identify the context of each track. The album clocks in at a few seconds longer than an hour and eighteen minutes, so there is a lot of Mamarosa's recorded work here.The first ten track are from a Phoenix Jazz LP titled Dodo Marmarosa: Piano Man that was recorded in Los Angeles on July 16, 1947. Mamarosa is backed by Barney Kessel on guitar and Gene Englund on bass. Tracks are:1. Dodo's Bounce2. Opus #53. You Thrill Me4. Compadoo5. I'm In Love6. Bopmatism7. Lover Come Back To Me8. Raindrops9. Smoke Gets In Your Eyes10. EscapeTracks 11 through 14 are from an Armed Forces Radio Service broadcast (11 and 12) and private recordings (13 and 14). 11 and 12 are from February 1946, and 13 and 14 were recorded on an unspecified date in 1947.

"You will love Teddy Charles on vibraphone on this album. This was Charles' eighth album as a leader (he was 29 when this was recorded in a single session for Jubilee in NYC on May 29, 1957. It was released later that year under catalog number JGM 1047. It clocks in at 39:47, so it's not super short like so many albums from the era.This is laid back with virtually no vibrato and the same relaxed playing that characterizes Red Norvo. You could not ask for better accompaniment with Oscar Pettiford on bass and Hal Overton on piano. I personally love the fact there there is no drummer because each track showcases Charles, Pettiford and Overton and drums would have been an intrusion. If you are new to Charles, he was a Julliard trained percussionist who was equally skilled on piano, vibraphone and drums.There is no track listing on this page at the time of this review so I am providing it - all Ellington tunes as the title implies:A1  Main Stem  4:45A2  Do Nothing 'Til You Hear From Me  5:06A3  Sophisticated Lady  9:36B1  Don't Get Around Much Anymore  5:57B2  Sherman Shuffle  7:07B3  The Mooch  6:20Overall, the music flows languorously with each member of the trio participating and playing off one another. Make no mistake that Charles is the centerpiece, but he gives ample space to both Pettiford and Overton. Also important (to me) is there no real liberties taken with the melodies of each track. The Duke, I am sure, approved when this album was released.I found my copy in a thrift shop and even on a cheap turntable and fair-to-good condition vinyl this album has reasonable sound quality. A copy in VG to pristine condition played on a decent turntable will be a real treat.",p
"This is one of Garland's late 50s albums he cut for Prestige's Moodsville subsidiary. This album should not be confused with a similar titled one featuring Garland's trio and Eddie Lockjaw Davis titled, [[ASIN:B000000YK4 Moodsville, Volume 1]]. At the time of this review there is no track list. The album contains the following tracks, which clock in at 43:26:A1  I Love You Yes I DoA2  Blues For AnnA3  I'll Never Stop Loving YouB1  And The Angels SingB2  Tain't Nobody's BusinessB3  Bassment BluesEvery track is basically a  ballad or slow tempo blues. Great for late evening background (or romantic) music. For me it is not an album I frequently play, although the tracks are in a few playlists on my MP3 player for when I want to wind down and chill.Unfortunately there are no sound samples (at the time of this review) to be found anywhere on Amazon, but you can find most of the tracks if you search the web. If you are familiar with Garland during the late 50s you probably have a good idea how this album will sound. This is especially true since he has Paul Chambers on bass and Art Taylor on drums backing him. The three of them were one of the tightest piano jazz trios from the era and their music here as on other albums has a definite swing and cohesiveness.This was recorded at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on November 21, 1958 and released in 1960. If you want to add some slower trio music to your collection this is a prime candidate.",w
"This is a live performance circa 1964 (I have been unable to nail down the exact date). The even is the After Hours Concert at the Esquire Theater in Los Angeles and is much wider than Just McCann. This concert (and to a degree album) has some historic significance because McCann introduces Monty Alexander whose debut album was recorded at the same concert - both for the Pacific Jazz label. Alexander 'borrowed' McCann's rhythm section that was comprised of Victor Gaskin on bass and Paul Humphrey on drums.Aside from the playing this album has wonderful ambiance from the crowd. I will say that if you dislike crowd noise and interaction you are NOT going to like this album. I thought it added to the listening pleasure, but have to admit that it's a bit much in spots. Otherwise the album has excellent sound quality.At the time of this review there are no sound samples or a track list on this page. There are entire tracks floating around on the web that are easy to search out, and the track list is:A1  El Soulo  3:16A2  Lavande  6:40A3  Spanish Onions  8:50B1  Get Them Grits  4:30B2  I Am In Love  5:30B3  Arabella  5:43B4  Maxie's Farewell  5:15With the exception of Cole Porter's I Am In Love, the album contains all of McCann's own compositions.",v
"Note: there are a few albums by this title, one of which is a compilation. I am reviewing the vinyl LP titled [[ASIN:B006LMZBD2 Alexander The Great]] that Alexander recorded for Pacific Jazz during the After Hours Concert at the Esquire Theater in Los Angeles. This is Alexander's debut album that established him as a 'contender' in 1964.At the time of this review there is no track listing or sound samples on this page. I can provide the tracks:A1 John Brown's Body 5:30A2 Jitterbug Waltz 3:59A3 Comin' Home Baby 5:45A4 If I Were A Bell 6:18B1 The Grabber 5:30B2 Autumn Leaves 5:59B3 I've Never Been In Love Before 5:30B4 Blues For Jilly 4:40Since this was live it explains how two of Alexander's compositions (The Grabber and Blues for Jilly) made it on the album. Normally new artists stick with standards, which do comprise the remaining tracks. From the start you can hear Les McCann's influence on Alexander (indeed, McCann also performed at the concert and introduced Alexander).The rhythm section is comprised of  Victor Gaskin on bass and Paul Humphrey on drums. They also backed McCann at the same concert and I am under the impression that Alexander was there as a guest. I cannot be sure, but I am surmising that given McCann's unmistakable influence on Alexander's playing that continues to this day that there were some behind the scenes machinations that got Alexander on this album. If you are inclined to track down McCann's album from the same concert it's titled Les McCann - Spanish Onions Pacific Jazz PJ-10097.Sound quality on this LP is excellent, even on my cheap USB turntable, and if you are an Alexander fan this is ground zero in his career.",J
"I've owned a copy of this album for decades and am reviewing the music and not the media nor the price.What I love is the arrangements, which are totally different from any I have heard. For example, Green Dolphin Street (as originally composed) has an ABAB format. The rendition on this album does too,  but the A section almost seamlessly segues into the B section. Nearly every other arrangement I've heard (and played) has an abrupt transition between the two. The other tracks are similar in that Sample takes a lot of liberties with the melody line as well as the phrasing and arrangements.Another thing is on this album Sample is back on an acoustic piano. I loved his playing on his earlier albums like Lighthouse 62 and Freedom Sound, and to be honest had drifted away when he and the Crusaders went the fusion route in the late 1960s/early 1970s. So this album is a nice change in that respect.Of course the rhythm section makes a lot of difference and having Ray Brown on bass practically guarantees that there would be a swinging pulse. As a drummer who has long admired Shelly Manne I have a personal reason for loving this album.Sadly there are no sound samples on this page, but if you are diligent and do a web search you will be rewarded with some. From those you can get a better picture of what I mean by arrangements being unique.This album was recorded in Los Angeles on November 28, 1975 for the Japanese label East Wind. Although the recording was done at the Warner Brothers Studios the production team was Japanese. The sound quality is superb. One final note: this product page at the time of this review does not contain a track listing. Here it is:A1  Yearnin'  5:04A2  On Green Dolphin Street 5:17A3  Satin Doll 5:38B1  Manha Do Carnaval  5:59B2  Round About Midnight 4:34B3  Funky Blues 5:10Total play time is 29:53.",D
"This album is really a double album set that is  [[ASIN:B003OFC2SG SINGS WITH THE PAT MORAN TRIO]] with the trio comprised of Patti Moran [McCoy] on piano, Scott LaFaro on bass and Gene Gammage on drums backing Beverly Kelly on vocals, and [[ASIN:B004FBEQN2 This is Pat Moran]] featuring just the trio. Both albums are listed in various discographies as being recorded in December 1957, although the trio-only one is claimed by Moran-McCoy to have been recorded a year later. Not disputed is both were recorded in New York.Here are some discrepancies that make these an incomplete collection of the trio recordings: Track 20 does not show up in discographies, including the one dedicated to these two albums that span pages 262 through 264 in Lafaro's biography written by his sister: [[ASIN:1574412736 Jade Visions: The Life and Music of Scott LaFaro]]. Also missing from this album are Spring is Here and This Love of Mine, both of which are from the Kelly album, and Stella by Starlight, When Your Lover Has Gone and Farewells from the Trio album.Despite the fact that this does not contain all the tracks from the trio sessions, it does contain a record of LaFaro's genius even at 21. That alone merits five stars in my opinion in spite of some missing tracks.All discographies that I have checked, including LaFaro's biography cited above confirm that LaFaro was, in fact, the bassist and Gammage the drummer on all tracks.Sadly there are no sound samples here, nor on the Kelly album page, but there are on the Trio page, which will give you a good idea of the music on this album. If you are a bassist, jazz historian or musicologist, or a LaFaro fan this album is a treasure despite the discrepancies.",f
"This album was recorded mere weeks after Chet Baker and Bird were 'home recorded' at the same venue. Like that album - [[ASIN:B005MVLS94 Bird & Chet: Live at the Trade Winds, 1952]], the sound quality on this one is not spectacular, but the music is. In fact some of the same musicians from the earlier session are on this one.Sadly there are no sound samples on this page at the time of this review. In a nutshell, this is mainly a horn-centric session with a young Chet Baker playing a lot more aggressively than he would on subsequent albums. There are two tracks where the ensemble downshifts and gives Al Haig a lot of room and places him in the front line: I'll Remember April and Sweet Georgia Brown.Here are the tracks:1. There'll Never Be Another You2. Bernie's Tune3. My Old Flame4. Avalon5. I'll Remember April6. How High The Moon7. Sweet Georgia BrownIf you love energetic music this is a great album. It was recorded live at the Trade Winds Club in Inglewood (a Los Angeles suburb) on August 4, 1952 and features the following line-up:Chet Baker on trumpet with Ted Ottison on trumpet on tracks 5 and 7, Sonny Criss on alto on tracks 1, 3 and 7, Jack Montrose on tenor sax on tracks 1, 4 and 7, Les Thompson on harmonica on track 4, and a rhythm section comprised of Al Haig on piano, Dave Bryant on bass and Larry Bunker on drums.",b
"Nearly every track in this compilation is excellent, although there is a handful that are marginal to my ears.

"Note that this album is out of print, but is part of a value-priced set titled [[ASIN:B00CSFXQZ6 8 Classic Albums]] as the first ten tracks on Disc Four.This 1962 album contains tracks that clearly show Lewis' strategy to move from a jazz piano trio format to more popular music (perhaps in response to Ray Charles' success in crossing over from R&B to pop.) The first five tracks on the album have a string section backing the trio.While the first five tracks comprising Side A is a foray into pop, Side B is still heavily rooted in jazz. The album has a consistent theme - Spring - and Lewis contributed three compositions to reinforce that theme. He wrote A1, A3 and B1, and B5 was written by bassist Eldee Young.  Since there is no track list at the time of this review here are the tracks on the album:SIDE AA1  Sound Of Spring 2:30A2  Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most 4:25A3  Blue Spring 3:00A4  Spring Is Here 4:22A5  Spring Will Be A Little Late This Year 2:43SIDE BB1  Spring Fever  2:35B2  It Might As Well Be Spring 3:52B3  Soft Winds 3:10B4  There'll Be Another Spring 2:30B5  Truly, Truly Spring 3:27The trio is comprised of Ramsey Lewis on piano, Eldee Young on bass and Red Holt on drums. The album was recorded for Argo at the United Recordings Studio in Los Angeles on February 14 and 15, 1962 and released later that year. Interestingly Ruth Brown (credited as the single artist who made Atlantic Records a name) and Leonard Chess of Chess records have producer credits.",l

"This is one of two collaborations between one of that era's most promising bassists whose life was tragically cut short at 25 and Pat Moran who now goes by Patti Moran McCoy.The 12 tracks comprising this album were recorded in New York in late 1957 with the following personnel: Pat Moran on piano, Scott LaFaro on bass and Gene Gammage on drums backing vocalist Beverly Kelly. The bassist and drummer are sometimes incorrectly credited as bassist John Doling and drummer Johnny Whited, but according to Scott LaFaro's sister in her biography of him ([[ASIN:1574412736 Jade Visions: The Life and Music of Scott LaFaro]] it was indeed LaFaro and Gammage.Since there is no track list at the time of this review here is what is on the album:01.

"This 3-disc set is out-of-print, but still offered used.  As I write this review the other formats offered - MP3 Music 39 Songs 2010 and Audio CD 2011 - are for different products that are not the same as this album.What makes this album great is it's a sampler that contains six tracks each for six truly great ladies in jazz. I'll list the contents of each disc below.Of course the choices are not going to satisfy everyone. For example, it would have been great had one of my favorites been included - Anita O'Day or Maxine Sullivan - and Dinah Washington is better known as an R&B artist. On the other hand, one cannot argue with either the choices made since each vocalist is one of the greats, or the tracks which do showcase their talents. And as for Ms. Washington: although she was often billed as the Queen of the Blues, she was also one great jazz singer. Her tracks on this album prove that.Here is what the set contains:DISC ONE:=============Sarah Vaughan=============01.  Lullaby of Birdland02.  All of Me03.  Lover Man04.  Over the Rainbow05.  Autumn in New York06.  My Heart Stood Still=============Dinah Washington=============07.  Caravan08.  Ain't Misbehavin'09.  Is You or Is You Ain't My Baby10.  Smoke Gets in Your Eyes11.

I've Taken a Fancy to You10.  My Man11.  You Waited Too Long12.  Sweet Georgia BrownAs you can see, the tracks are familiar.

No surprises or weirdness, and the tracks are organized by vocalist instead of scattered across the three discs with no coherency or reason.",g
"This album contains some rare tracks spanning the period between 1946 and 1950. As I write this review it's out-of-print, but fortunately still available as Disc Six in a 10-disc set titled [[ASIN:B005D4XYUQ Kind of Clarke]].Sadly there are no sound samples on this page. It would be presumptuous of me to attempt to describe the songs comprising these tracks because such descriptions would only reflect my personal tastes and biases. I can, however, provide detailed information regarding when, where and my whom each track was recorded. That information will give you some idea as to the music itself based on the signature sounds of the musicians in the sessions.The first four tracks were recorded in NY on September 5, 1946 and feature Kenny Dorham and Fats Navarro on trumpet, Sonny Stitt on alto sax, Ray Abrams on tenor sax, Eddie DeVerteuil on baritone sax, Bud Powell on piano, John Collins on guitar, Al Hall on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.Tracks 5-7 are Kenny Clarke Sextet, recorded in Paris on March 2, 1948 and feature Benny Bailey on trumpet, John Brown on alto sax, Cecil Payne on baritone sax, Ralph Schecroun on piano, Al McKibbon on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.Tracks 8-11 were recorded in Paris on May 4, 1948 as the the Kenny Clarke Orchestra. Personnel are: Dick Collins on trumpet, Hubert Fol on alto sax, Jean-Claude Fohrenbach on tenor sax, Andre Hodeir under the pseudonym of ""Claude Laurence"" on violin, Jacques Denjean on piano, Charles Montaggioni on guitar, Alf Masselier on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.Tracks 12 through 15 were recorded in Paris on May 5, 1948 as the Michel De Villers et Son Orchestre comprised of Claude Dunson on trumpet, Michel De Villers on alto sax, Jean-Claude Fohrenbach on tenor sax, Jacques Denjean on piano, Charles Montaggioni on guitar, Alf Masselier on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.Tracks 16-19 were recorded in Paris on October 29, 1949 as the Hubert Fol et ses Be-Bop Minstrels. This group was comprised of Nat Peck on trombone, Hubert Fol on alto sax, Bernard Peiffer on piano, Jean Bouchety on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.Final two tracks were recorded in Paris on June 7, 1950 as Kenny Clarke and his Orchestra. Personnel on this session were: Nat Peck on trombone, Hubert Fol on alto sax, James Moody on tenor sax, Gerald Wiggins on piano, Pierre Michelot on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.If you are a Klook fan this album documents an important period of his playing approximately a decade after he went professional. I do recommend that you consider the 10-disc set mentioned above if you want this album plus a wider set of examples of Klook's work.",^
"It's hard to dislike this album, although there are better deals that document Anita's Verve Years. For one, I would go with [[ASIN:B005I4UMCO 8 Classic Albums]], which is slightly more expensive with a lot more tracks. However, this album contains some true gems.Since as of the date of this review there is no track listing for this album I am providing one (and their source albums).The first seven tracks, plus track 23 are from her 1958 album titled [[ASIN:B000WLVBBE Anita O'Day Sings The Winners]]. They are: Take the A Train, Early Autumn, Four Brothers, My Funny Valentine, Sing, Sing, Sing, What's Your Story Morning Glory, Peanut Vendor and Star Eyes.Track 8, Whisper Not, is from one of my favorite albums titled [[ASIN:B000V697T8 Anita O'Day And The Three Sounds]]. Sadly this is the only track that is from that amazing album.Stomping at the Savoy and Don't Be That Way (tracks 9 & 11) are from [[ASIN:B000V6728Q Pick Yourself Up]], while Hershey Bar (track 10) is from [[ASIN:B001NZJ3HW Cool Heat]] and Peel Me a Grape (track 12) is from [[ASIN:B000VRH2IU Time For Two]] (another album I absolutely love and wish was better represented in this collection.)Tracks 13-21 are from [[ASIN:B000WLQKHO Swings Cole Porter]], consisting of Just One of Those Things, Love for Sale, Easy to Love, I Get a Kick Out of You, What Is This Thing Called Love, Night and Day, Get Out of Town, I've Got You Under My Skin, and De-Lovely. Somehow the producer managed to include every one of my favorites!Interestingly, the next-to-last track - Honeysuckle Rose - is from her first Verve album, [[ASIN:B00000470I This Is Anita]].Overall, this is a solid collection of Anita's Verve years, and are drawn from albumsnext-to-last that are more centered on orchestral arrangements and backing (two exceptions are tracks 8 and 12.) If you are new to Anita's music this is a good starting place for her post-Swing era work, although I recommend that you check [[ASIN:B005I4UMCO 8 Classic Albums]] before making a final purchase decision.",S

I purchased this CD thinking it was a certain album that I used to own (on cassette).. but it turns out that it was basically not even the particular recordings that I was searching for.There were no samples from the CD that I could listen to.. so I had no idea that this was not what I was after. (All the tracks listed were the those found on my old cassette). But the tracks on the CD were NOT even the songs they were supposed to be (apart from one of them.. and even that one was listed under the wrong name)I did end up liking the tracks on this CD (even though they were not the ones listed at all) so I gave it a couple of stars -- because I liked it and it was very inexpensive..EDIT: At least one of the songs that was found on it was the track that I was looking for.,t

The stubbly-jawed, green-eyed, beanie-wearing 34 year old Canadian singer/songwriter gives a very impressive account of himself, and has already sold more than 100,000 albums, due mainly to a killer first single ""Bad Day"", something with which we can all identify.""Where is the moment when we need it the mostYou kick up the leaves and the magic is lostThey tell me your blue sky's faded to greyThey tell me your passion's gone awayAnd I don't need no carrying onStand in the line just ahead of the lawYou're faking a smile with the coffee you goYou tell me your life's been way off lineYou're falling to pieces every timeAnd I don't need no carrying onCause you had a bad dayYou're taking one downYou sing a sad song just to turn it aroundYou say you don't knowYou tell me don't lieYou work at a smile and you go for a rideYou had a bad dayThe camera don't lieYou're coming back down and you really don't mindYou had a bad dayYou had a bad day""Powter wrote the songs on this album over a one year period, his musical taste inspired by childhood violin sessions, accompanying his mother on piano.  The second single will be ""Free Loop"", but the excellent ""Song 6"" would also have been a great pick.This album is definitely a keeper, other great tracks being ""Jimmy Gets High"" and ""Lie to Me"" (falsetto bits and all), ""Styrofoam"" and ""Hollywood"", but then every track is a potential single.  The only problem is that there are only ten songs, and that's a crying shame.Amanda Richards, October 6, 2005",e

"In the opinion of most concert pianists Josef Hofmann was the greatest pianist of the recording era.  Of course there's some dispute on such topics.  He was certainly the greatest interpreter of Chopin.  Being born and raised in Poland didn't hurt that one little bit.  This completes my collection of Hofmann and it's a great conclusion to the sequence of the sequence of ""The Complete Josef Hofmann"".",b

"Listening to this CD is a relaxing, enjoyable learning opportunity. So many of us struggle on a daily basis with food choices. What should we eat? What will happen if we eat the wrong thing? This CD helps the listener relax and find inner peace with eating, food and the entire process of nourishing your body, mind and spirit.The voice of the narrator is calming and peaceful. He walks you through some easy meditation practices and breathing exercises. By the time I was finished listening to this, I felt calmer and was visibly more relaxed. If you are struggling with a weight issue or some type of eating disorder, this may give you a chance to stop and evaluate the choices you are making. I found that after listening to this CD I was able to clearly identify the problems with my own eating habits and look at them from a new perspective.The one thing I would have changed about this, was the jarring chime. I didn't feel that it fit in with the relaxing environment the rest of the CD produces for the listener. I almost felt that while it was attention grabbing, I was ringside at a boxing match. The rest of the CD is excellent though, so it is hard to find too much fault.I would recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for a relaxing experience that will help you understand yourself, your relationship with food and is looking to learn basic practices to calm your mind. A great choice.",z

My husband and I were in Bayside Miami a few weeks back.  We were joined by my Cousin who I had not seen in over 30 years.  As we walked in the Bayside area he mentioned of the music that usually plays there and how people enjoy dancing.  So we went there and were able to appreciate the music of Erica Denz and her band.  It was great!  The dancer and back up singer of the group started to go through the group of expectators selling what was supposed to be this CD posted on this Amazon website.  To our surprise the CD had some rappers music with questionable lyrics even though the label shows Ms. Denz's songs.  We've attempted to call and send messages to Ms. Denz multiple time to let her know of this matter but have been unsuccessful.  She does not return calls nor replies to her Facebook messages.  This is very disappointing and disconcerting to us.  We paid $20 for two CDs.  Folks I would think it twice before buying this CD.  We were ripped off!!!  We reported this incident to the Miami Attorney General.No. I would not buy her CDs because she has evaded/ignored our telephone messages and facebook emails...So sad to take advantage of tourists like that because they know they are leaving and most likely won't listen to the CD's until after they are gone from Miami.,X
"I'm a serious side sleeper with neck issues and have tried any number of pillows over the years. This actually works! I wasn't sure going in that it would be any better or worse than anything else but I'm very happy I took the chance. It's soft and the shaping allows it to support my head without canting my neck either up or down. I did cover it with one of my king size pillowcases (I'm not sure it would fit a regular size) but have been using it for several days now. I'm sleeping better and waking up less stiff. If you are a side sleeper, I'd say this is definitely worth a try.",M
"Throat Culture were I believe an Ohio-based A-Capella Quintet whose career blew thru' in early to mid nineties.In short, they were brilliant!This is their first album, and unlike the latter ""Up with Angst"" it's primarily composed of cover material. but oh wow, what covers!It kicks off with a brilliant and lively rendition of Desmond Deckers' ""Israelites"" that morphs into Sam Cooke's 'Working in Coal Mine' and back out again, followed by a guitar-free version of Hendrix' 'Crosstown Traffic' that somehow sounds better than the original. Later in the album are such classics as 'Fly Like an Eagle', '50 ways to leave your lover' and 'St James Infirmary' - all delivered note perfect, and using only sounds made by voice and percussing the human frame.Outstanding in this CD are originals 'Easter Island Head' - such a catchy and funny song I still attempt my own version in the shower, and the tongue in cheek 'Sitting On the Groom's Side' - a humorous take on weddings.As i recall, this was pretty much their live set....although notably missing is the showstopping 'Sweet Dreams' which somehow didn't make this recording and was saved for the ""Angst"" album, oh well, nothing can be perfect.If you enjoy acapella OR if you remember this talented band from wayback - time to put this CD on the deck and listen.PS - somehow there was a connection to the band 'Oswald & the Herringbones' - someone somewhere MUST have a bunch of copies of this album on CD or tape.TIME for a re-issue!!!!1",Z
"Brilliance!Clash at the peak of their game with a heartfelt 'I fought the law' - reportedly recorded just after the 'guns on the roof' arrest, ""Capital radio"" (not 'capitol radio' which was a re-recording.....and done for (I think Kenny Everret Show?), and the two songs hanging over from 101'ers and London SS....'Gates of the West' and ""Groovy Times"" - which don't show up anyplace else very often.ANYWAY - if you're a Clash aficionado, i don't need to rabbit on about the wonder of this EP, if you're not a Clash fan.....you're unlikely to care anyway.But for those of us who were there at the Electric Circus in Manchester, or wherever you caught Clash gigging.....THIS raw sounding (but not live) set is a wonderful trip down punk memory lane.Watchout for all the gobbin' down in the front row...........:-)",r

"Hypnosis is so relaxing that I try to listen to one CD a day. In colder weather I feel it works best to put on a sweater and socks and to lay in a comfortable bed with a heated mattress pad and blanket or duvet. I say this because it can get cold laying still for a while.This CD has two hypnosis sessions. One is a waking hypnosis where at the end you are back to reality and alert afterwards. The second is a hypnosis that leads you into a sleepy state so you can drift off to sleep with music and ocean waves.This CD helps you feel positive about leaving the house and promotes a more confident and calm attitude so you don't fear new experiences and unfamiliar places.Rachael Eccles has a real talent for visualization and takes you to a peaceful beach. Her soothing voice will help you relax and solve your issues too! Give this CD some time to work. Being afraid of going outside is a real problem and takes some psychological work to undo. I am happy going to familiar places but still struggle with going to new stores, parks etc. This summer I'm going to start to be more adventurous so planning ahead!~The Rebecca Review",b
"I'm fairly new to hypnosis CDs. Mostly I've used them in the past to get to sleep faster and found them effective. I prayed and prayed that I would lose some weight and the answer seems to be to get some hypnosis CDs and retrain my thinking about eating and exercising.Since I've been using weight loss hypnosis CDs I've exercised nearly every day and changed some of my eating habits. It therefore seems worth it to devote time to hypnosis instead of reading more books about weight loss because really what you are dealing with is the subconscious mind and how it has been programed. We all know what is good and bad in the food world, but often we just don't have the self control to make the right choices.This CD is excellent for its deep relaxation visualizations. If you can darken your room, turn off lights, get into bed with a warm comforter or heating blanket you will find it much easier to fall deeply into hypnosis. Make sure that no one disturbs you. Tell people in your home that you are going to be unavailable for as long as it takes to do one, two or three of these hypnosis sessions. I like doing all three because I find that the most effective way to relax.The first hypnosis session on this CD is a waking hypnosis which means you will go deep into relaxation, then have helpful thoughts put into your subconscious and will be told to awaken at the end. The second session is just for 5 minutes and can be used when you are short on time but need some positive reinforcement. The last session is a hypnosis which guides you through similar images to the first one, with a little change here or there. You are left to fall asleep to calming music at the end. So perfect to listen to in the evening when you are going to bed.Rachael Eccles really has a gift for helping people solve all their problems. I've been trusting her to solve a lot of mine lately! She truly wants to guide you to a place where you are more in control of your life and are not leaving things just up to chance. I think a lot of overeating is stress related and this helps you feel a sense of calm and serenity so you can be more aware of your choices each day.I found this CD has some really beautiful visualizations especially the garden and hammock that take you deep into a world of relaxing hypnosis. I've tried another weight loss hypnosis CD and they all help, but this one is my current favorite because it makes me also feel way less stress. After listening I feel centered and motivated to lose weight.~The Rebecca Review",[
"A friend of mine in Australia told me he was listening to exotica from the 60s and I found this as a result. It is very relaxing and a total travel trip back in time. There are vocals but no lyrics and it is more classical. I do think the album cover is pretty neat too. So I'm listening to this while baking banana cake with cream cheese icing. I hear mostly piano, drums, flute, strings and other orchestral sounds. So if you want to listen to something from the 60s that is classical this is a good choice.~The Rebecca Review",a
It is difficult to imagine how two people who could create such ecstasy with their voices would no longer be talking. Fortunately this CD captures a time of spontaneity and playful chemistry. This is worth owning if you are a real fan. There are some original songs and three covers which are very well done.~The Rebecca Review,p
"A treasured collection for the New Age and World Music fan. This music captures your mind and spirit and is an evocative and exciting collection which will open your mind and take you above the plain of ordinary consciousness.""Yeha Noha"" takes you into the mind of an eagle as it soars high above the earth swirling to the sky. You can feel the energy in the sky and see the sun rising. They say if you see an eagle soaring up to the sky, it means good things will happen to you. This title of this song means: ""Wishes of Happiness and Prosperity.""Sweet Lullaby makes you think of the scent of rain and fresh earth, perhaps a walk through an African veld in the afternoon while you listen to the beat of drums somewhere in the distance.A good set of speakers or headphones is a must so you can enjoy all the nuances of this collection. This music will engulf a room and promotes peace, joy and a feeling of harmony with life. You can literally drift away to another world by listening to this music. It is very uplifting and evokes images of peaceful places and blissful journeys.""Chi Mai"" is an incredibly sad piece of music so I guess this is not all joy and happiness but there is a certain poignancy in the music which speaks to future happiness and an feeling of being engulfed in love no matter what happens in life.""Prelude"" will take you to India. Yanni's music was my first introduction to mood music and it is fitting that his music is on this CD.""Cavatina"" is a beautiful piece which is extremely evocative of romance and country picnics. Happiness and Hope are the feelings this music will evoke in you. Perhaps the start of a new day.On the second CD, ""Children"" is a deep water piece which reminds me of whales playing in the ocean and of ships sailing in the wind. You can almost hear the cries of whales. The beat is very up tempo and is in contrast with the first CD which seems to be a slower pace. You never want the song to end and it does seem to have the feeling of eternity.""Chacharpaya"" has South American/Mexican flair and is filled with flutes and drums.  ""Protection"" was more light smooth Jazz. ""The Sun Rising"" is perhaps the best song on this CD as far as mood music goes.""Sadness Part 1"" will be one of the most recognizable songs. ""Brideshead"" is classic music with violin and harp and is followed by ""Pie Jesu"" which is ethereal. ""Schindler's List"" is a haunting piece with a sad violin and a sense of unfulfilled dreams.There were a few pieces I fast forwarded over, but overall, I think you will enjoy this set. I would choose this imported selection over the other CD's because you just get so many more selections. I think you will play the first CD more than the second, but it depends on your mood. Return to your senses with this beautiful compilation.~The Rebecca Review",d
Great gospel big band recording.  Great charts that are well-played.  Brentwood-Benson sells the actual arrangements that you can play.,D
"I discovered Say Hello To Sunshine through one of my favorite American rock bands awhile ago (Finch) and instantly fell in love with their sound. Listening to this EP gave me flashbacks of my late teen years, just after high school filling basements with music, jamming with my friends, and trying to form a screamo band. These guys have really done it, you can hear a range of influences from Finch, to Deaftones, and even some Juliana Theory influence in this EP. I love this band, and I sincerely hope they come on tour in the U.S. one day, but until then... Buy this album, you will thank me later.",C

"Belleruth is a pioneer, and her audios are all first-rate.  I have not only used all her titles with my therapy clients and my friends - everything from stress to cancer therapy - but they have also been immensely helpful to me personally.  Everyone has experienced heartbreak, abandonment or betrayal, so this title speaks to us all.  With deep power as you sink into unconscious mind trance, you gain resources to counteract what circumstances or other people have yanked out of you.  Highly recommended.",D

"I finally crossed Hedwig off of my &#34;To Watch&#34; list this week, and I instantly became obsessed with it. I keep thinking about how much I enjoyed it, which means that, of course, I now have to have copies of the soundtrack and DVD to add to my collection. JCM's costumes and make-up are positively fantastic, and I love how Hedwig can convey emotion without having to say anything at all. These songs have rightfully earned Hedwig a spot as one of the top rock musicals of all time. I just wish I had gotten into this earlier so I could have seen NPH or Michael C. Hall perform as Hedwig.",g

"I've heard this band live now and this music is great.  As a live band they really rate as good as I have heard.  Vocals are strong and well done, by pretty much every one in the band.  The Horns are awesome, right there with any of the best out there and end to end, these guys do rock.  When I saw them July 5th, 2014 they had the crowd following them around the arena.  Danced and sang along with them all night, it was just as good as seeing the high dollar bands I've gone to see over the years, loud and proud, just not too loud. They come out of New Orleans, cover all the genres of music, from Armstrong to ZZ and Beatles to about whoever you might want to hear.  If you get a chance to see them, take it and enjoy.  Great sounds!",I
"Jung Ho Seok aka J-Hope, Hobi, *literal* Sunshine has been holding out on us.I mean, the signs were there, if we cared to look: BTS is perhaps the most extensively documented band in modern history, and there are plenty of glimpses of Hobi irked and maybe a little sad, but only when the cameras are focused on someone else. But he, and probably Jin, carry an outsized share of the positivity weight.But this is what happens when you keep turning that little crank on the side of the box. Keep winding. Go ahead.It all comes down. All of it. And it's not all pretty. Although, let's face it: Ho Seok is one of the prettiest humans ever to walk the planet. I digress. Sorry. What I mean is - Jack In The Box has moments of delicate beauty. Equal Sign and Future are lovely, the first for humanity in general, the second for one special love. But there's a conflagration going on. MORE and Arson in particular hit you hard with sides of Jung Ho Seok that J-Hope keeps mostly hidden.It's all out now, though, and it is freaking glorious.MORE is a straightforward headbanger. Arson stays closer to hip hop. But they both FEEL great. Ho Seok's got a gift for rhythm and sound - his lyrics are percussive and convert information more by how they feel than by what they are overtly saying. The beats and embellishments are divine booty shakers. You get the message because you listen to the songs over and over - they feel that good even though the tone is dark.Well, in fairness, Arson is both dark and blindingly bright. The album's closer ponders whether, now that everything is on fire, he should put it out or let it burn. You can decide for yourself, but it seemed to me like he decided to pour gas on it.",x
"Woo sung has made an ep that encapsulates this particular earthbound moment with humor, irony, and a little regret - all wrapped up in a 12 minute nonstop sing and dance-along. !!! this modern life, indeed.Seriously. In Phase Me, he taunts an ex-lover or someone he wishes were an ex. The melody and lyrics are less bombastic/more seductive than I Will Survive, but it’s a similar emotional vein. The narrator is at maximum incandescence and In the video is getting  a LOT of attention from uh people. Many people. And you kind of think, good for you- until you notice that the title is spelled PHASE. Which, if you like Woosung, takes you straight to Moon. And phases. And the message immediately changes. He’s great now, but it’s inevitable that the next phases will tend towards darkness before the light comes back. Which pulls you into the shadows despite how upbeat and catchy the song is on its face.Lightness and dark weave all through Moth; every song touches on both and on the need to protect one’s personal light from people and circumstances that would diminish or demolish it.And all things taken together, the dominant message seems to to one of defiance. In spite of past sadness. In spite of what’s after you. In spite of what is on the way.Highly recommend.",g

"&#34;Speedster&#34; is Generations from Exile Tribe's 3rd release and that I wanted first and foremost because there are so many songs on it that I love, but &#34;Generation Ex&#34; which is their 2nd release and I believe came out in 2015(?) is still in my 5-star love range. There are a few songs that I skip but there is a chance that those few may end up becoming favorites later.&#34;Sing it Loud&#34; is the opener and it is a solid get-the-hype going song. It dips a little with &#34;Everlasting&#34; but then goes into a great trio of songs with &#34;Higher,&#34; &#34;Always with You&#34; and &#34;My Only Love&#34; which all are very listenable with great pop sensibilities. I really like &#34;Revolver&#34; although I'm not sure why. The last 5 songs though are really, really good. In fact, my two favorite Gene songs are the last two on this disc (STORY and Hana). Those two songs are just perfect as far as I'm concerned and definitely worth the money I spent for this CD.",R
"I don't know how I came across Generations from Exile Tribe, but once I heard one song from them (&#34;Ageha&#34;), I wanted to hear more. I actually opened an account with iTunes and Spotify so I could hear more of their music and so far, I haven't been disappointed. In fact, I'm rather addicted to the music.I don't really know much about them except that they are made up of 2 vocalists and 5 dancers which is an interesting set up to me, but apparently is something of a standard with the company they are affiliated with. Outside of that, I don't know much more about them except that their songs are top grade pop-dance-r&b music. The really good stuff that makes you want to smile and move. &#34;Evergreen&#34;, which is on this CD, is about as good a pop song as I've ever heard. I can imagine that 10 years from now, it'll sound as good then as it did on the first listen. Other songs on this CD are solid. I really like &#34;Loadstar&#34; and &#34;Gimme!&#34; but I have the softest of soft spots for &#34;I Believe In Miracles&#34; which sounds straight out of 1977 and I mean that in the best way possible.It doesn't look like their CDs and/or DVDs are available from Amazon US except via third party sellers and thank goodness, the third party seller that I buy from is super reliable and I'm quite happy with them. Generations from Exile are available on Spotify and iTunes so if anyone wants to check them out, that's a good place to start. While I like listening via iTunes and Spotify, I still like having the hard copy CD in my hands and this is my first CD that I've bought for this group. It was actually released a few years ago so I've got some catching up to do and I look forward to collecting them all.",k
"I've been wanting this song in 'hard copy' for awhile so when I saw this CD/DVD combo (and it was my birthday), I snapped it up. The seller was great. The product came in good shape and in good time all the way from Japan so I'm really happy. I was a little worried about region but I was able to play it with the Power DVD with no issues. The song is one of my favorites from Exile the Second as is the music video so it is nice to have the hard copy for my library.",F
One of his beat albums.  Just love the whole thing.,F
If you like Hoyt you should have this album. Just buy it. Really.,D
"A little bit of Bowie history, but the recording is not all that great. The bass on I've Got You Babe is ridiculously high and overpowers the vocals, I don't know what they were thinking on that. The &quot;and friends&quot; portions are mostly skip-worthy, especially since the transitions are so jarring at times. If you've never heard it before, it's maybe worth picking up, but I was underwhelmed. It seems likely there was only so much they could do with the source material, but the end result is just not that exciting.",p
This less known record adds another dimension to Mark Linkous's unworldly talent. A must-have for diehard Sparklehorse fans like myself.,I
"Very great album!  From the moment I first heard this album, I loved it. 20 years later, a few of the songs seems somehow, melodically dated, but most are just as wonderful as I remember.",p
"This is an excellent CD to listen to, while making coffee (or tea), especially on a crisp morning.  I find that listening to the CD during my daily commute also helps with the crazy urban traffic.  It's upbeat enough not to put you to sleep, but soothing enough to keep me out of the road rage zone.  Some if it is a bit cheesy 90's contemporary jazz, but overall it was very much worth the price. As I've pretty much said, the album is a great autumn one to wake up to.",m
Truly one of the most outstanding CD's ever. Can't say enough about this heavenly  music.,f
I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND I LOVE THIS SOUNDTRACK!!!! this has to be my favorite live action Japanese movie of all time!!!,A
"Love this cd! Good quality, came w case and booklet, just one crack in the case, which is fine by me.",I

"Purchased this because of the songs offered when purchasing a SoundBlaster music and video card back in the late 80’s. At that time, it was the best product on the market. SoundBlaster is now gone, but the music and isn’t and now my grandchildren get to experience what my children did, way back when! Will need a Dos emulation software to run the complete program with the videos to the music. This includes setting up a virtual drive. But if you just want to hear the songs, they will play on Windows 10 back.",s
"The CD contains a wide ranging collection of classical musical of a more soulful nature, hence the title of the CD. I really like the performance of Pavanne (a quicker tempo than other versions I've heard) and Chopin's Etude. Perfect for a rainy afternoon with candles lit and a warm cup of my favorite beverage.",m
"I love the movie and the tone that the music sets. Christopher Young is one of my favorite composers, I first noticed his music in the movie Rounders. He really knows how to set the mood of the scene. I had waited for a bit because this price was a little high. Once it got within range I got it and very pleased with my purchase.",e
I had this album on tape growing up and went to get it again so that I can still enjoy it.,z
"I had been looking for this cd for a while and I remember at one point-this cd was about $400 on Amazon, they must have found more or something, because I couldn't believe that I had gotten this for 12.99. I have always enjoyed the music to this as well as the movie and listened to it over & over again. I really have enjoyed Amazon, even more when they developed deals with used cd & book places. Very pleased with this purchase.",L
"Hole's Unplugged stands amongst the long running series best and yet, remains unreleased officially.  This CD has been produced by a fly by night label looking to cash in on a loop hole of broadcasted material of a certain age and unfortunately, the quality shows.  While the original broadcast had been bootlegged a few dozen times throughout the 1990's in varying quality, the majority of those CDs left much to be desired in sound.  This CD runs in the middle pack of those old bootlegs.  The CDs blips, drops sound, skips in audio and only a third of it will rip into a media library.  Mid 90's bootleg entitled Unglued remains the pinnacle of this recording and even that is not up to par with officially released Unplugged recordings from other artists.Hole's Valentine's Day Unplugged deserves an official release and from one fan to another, this recording certainly isn't it.  May the buyer beware.Hopefully Erlandson or Auf Der Maur will make good on their promises to keep Hole's legacy alive and officially release this set one day, in entirety (as of the date of this review, only ""Softer, Softest"" and ""Season Of The Witch"" have seen release in an official format).",C
"For fans of Cher, the ""Stars"" album has been a sticking point.  There have been petitions, online campaigns and out right begging of anyone who will listen - including Cher herself - for a physical CD release of the album.  There has been false starts, confusion as to owns the rights, and just time passing by without any sign of it on the horizon.  Seems as though Cher & Co. have been beaten to the punch by some Argentine bootleggers who have taken the wide open opportunity  to release it on their own with the two albums that came afterwards for this package.Is it unofficial?  Yes.  If the grammatical errors weren't enough to give it away, the flimsy packaging will (make sure to have a protective sleeve handy for safe keeping, otherwise this CD set will fall apart pretty quickly).  The artwork is grainy, dull, poorly presented and pixelated.Sound quality?  The sound quality quickly makes up for the shady packaging.  Outside of time intensive, fan produced remastering, this is the best sound quality I have heard of these three albums outside of their original vinyl pressings.What is it?  This isn't Married Cher.  This isn't Disco Cher.  This isn't big hair, fishnets, Rock Cher.  This isn't Showgirl Cher.  This is Cher in the 70's taking a more low-key, soft rock approach.  Her voice has never been better or more present than it is on ""Stars"".  ""These Days"" is truly a long lost gem that has been buried in time.  ""I'd Rather Believe In You"" is split across the two discs and very much continues the sounds began on ""Stars"".  Her version of ""Knock On Wood"" is not to be missed.  Musically, the only pitfall to this set is the ""Cherished"" album that closes out the second disc.  Cher picks up Storytime Cher (""Half-Breed"", ""Gypsy Tramps & Thieves"", etc.) and the results are very mixed.  ""Cherished"" is definitely for fans only.Hopefully, Cher and Co. will come around to releasing these albums officially one day.  They certainly deserve to be heard once again outside of bootlegged discs and fan forums.",J
Me encanta este álbum. Es poderoso! Tiene pistas al final. Lo Recomiendo,l
"It's only 2 pages, but there is good stuff here. It also backs up some of the stuff I've read about praise the the Gallup books and The One Minute Manager.  One of the simple ideas is to ask your employee what kind of recognition is meaningful to them (of course based on their personality that can be a challenge on its own, especially when you are dealing with engineers).",q

"I love Jamila! She knows SO much and is a wonderful teacher. I got this CD and it is PACKED with all of the rhythmic variations ever used in Belly Dance. Get a copy and then focus on one rhythm at a time. Work your way through the whole CD (don't rush it; learn it,) and I guarantee, you will be the hottest zill player like you never thought possible.",m

"My niece went crazy when I gave her this. She liked the cards/pictures and booklets that come with it. I’m not sure if it comes with the option to download the digital album, but it should, most people don’t have cd players/writers anymore",V
I was fortunate enough to see this group playing at the Orlando West walk way ; their music is so beautiful yet holds a beat that is energetic.  My grandkids say they do not like classical music but when I play some of these music pieces I hear them say; hey this stuff is great.I also work out and kickbox and bike ride and this music has been a great addition to every day chores and work outs.I am so glad I bumped into this group; and how wonderful to see them as well; they were adorned in costumes representing the era of when classical music was introduced and then you hear them and look around and everyone listening is moving with the beats. Loved it !!!,m
Beautiful songs!,O
"This album filled my teen years, and I still search for it hoping it will be redone in digital format. Wish I had the means to do it myself.",f
This waa a wonderful Christmas gift for my mother in law.,C
"These songs may not have been originally recorded by Jackie Gleason's orchestra, but they are some of America's most beloved melodies. No vocals, just the soft instrumentals of music that should be preserved for generations to come.",k
This is a amazing story of courage and faith! You will not be disappointed. It is well made and the content of the story is exceptional!,\
"When I got the package, I was stunned. I thought it was going to be a DVD! I even went back to the original ad, and there it was, the word &#34;vinyl&#34;. So I played it, and since I had been in the last Armor OCS class, it was evocative and interesting. I'm looking forward to sharing it at our next reunion.",m

My first venture into J Geils albums. Great collection. I was surprised to find how many I knew from the radio.,A
"I had heard of pianist George Winston but wasn't really familiar with this work.  However, when I saw this CD at a used book sale, I thought it would be perfect for using when I teach yoga, and so I purchased it.  As I had hoped, this music is soothing and peaceful.  ""Color/Dance"" is calming, starting slow with a bit of build up (perfect for early in yoga class!).  I also like the even-tempo of ""Stars.""  Some of the tunes are a bit more upbeat, such as ""Moon"" and yet ""Too Much Between Us"" has a very quiet feel.  Overall, I'm definitely glad to have acquired this album and would consider purchasing others in the series.",K
"I found this CD at a used book sale and purchased it to use when teaching yoga.  The peaceful wave sounds are perfect for any type of relaxation, from yoga to massage to simply chilling out on your own.  My only reason for giving it 4 stars is that the various tunes aren't really distinction from one another--but that will work perfectly for anyone looking for more homogeneous, uninterrupted background music.",`
"I am a yoga teacher, and I am always looking for peaceful, non-instrumental music to use in my classes.  Native American flute tends to work well, so when I came across this CD of flutes, guitar, and keyboard at a resale store, I thought it would be perfect for my needs. Unfortunately no times are given either on the CD case or on the disc itself.  When I played the CD for the firs time, I was pleased to discover that most of the songs are in the 5-7 minute range, which works well for my yoga playlists.  I have listed the 12 tracks on the CD below along with times for each.1.  Open Heart, 6:282.  Above the Clouds, 6:053.  On The Open Water, 3:404.  Still Small Voice, 6:435.  A Light Flickers Inside, 7:276.  Mountain Song, 5:417.  Silent Wings, 4:488.  Everlasting Love, 6:469.  Breath Of Life, 5:1110. Pacific, 6:3011. The Way Home, 5:4412. Wind Makes Waves Of Grass, 4:37The album begins slowly and gently with ""Open Heart.""  In addition to the main instruments, soft chimes can be heard in the background at times.  The next two tracks continue this methodical pace, with ""On The Open Water"" adding more guitar.  ""Still Small Voice"" sounded similar to another artist's tune, although I couldn't quite place it.  With very little sound other than the flute, ""Silent Wings"" was one of the quietest tracks, whereas I found ""Everlasting Love"" to be a bit more resonant.  The one song I didn't like quite as much was ""Pacific""; the louder, sustained notes felt more discordant to me.  Almost any of these tunes would be ideally soothing for shavasana, or final relaxation in yoga, and I particularly liked ""The Way Home.""I would recommend this CD for yoga, meditation, massage, or just easy listening at home/in the office.",I
"As the title suggests, this 60-minute practice by Stephanie Keach consists of a gently flowing series of yoga postures. Performed entirely on the floor, the poses offer a combination of restorative work and mild stretches. Stephanie starts you off in a supported cobbler's pose (using a blanket as a bolster), where she guides you through some basic pranayama (yogic breathing) work. Removing the bolster but continuing to lie on your back, you will perform knee hugs, hip opening work (including half dead bug pose), and a reclined twist. Next it's on to hands and knees for cat rolls, child's pose, and cobra, working up to a flowing series which seamlessly combines these three postures (Stephanie's study under Kali Ray is apparent here). Moving to a seated position, Stephanie performs neck rolls, a simple seated twist, cow seat, and then full cow pose (unfortunately, you may find that your upper body is not sufficiently warmed up for this posture). The final seated posture is head-to-knee pose using a strap; Stephanie has you flow in and out of this pose several times before holding it wherever you are able to do so. Returning to lying on your back, you will work your abs with knee drops and then perform bridge and crossed leg twist. Finally, Stephanie sets you up for a long (about 10 minutes) savasana, with only the sound of gentle music playing in the background until a soft bell calls you to finish the practice.This video reminded me very much of Rainbeau Mars' Pure Tranquility, partly because both practices are performed entirely on the floor, and partly because Stephanie's teaching style is very reminiscent of Rainbeau's, particularly with her frequent focus on the breath. Stephanie also talks about our overactive ""monkey mind,"" encouraging you to let go of thoughts and to concentrate on your body instead. Overall, this is a very nice, calming, relaxing practice accessible to all levels of yoga practitioners.",]
"NOTE:  This review is based on reading the book, not listening to the audio version.In the second chapter of this book (actually labelled as ""3"" because this is the second prime number), we are introduced to Christopher, the narrator, who is writing a mystery novel as a class project. Christopher is an extremely intelligent 15-year old who just happens to be autistic. He begins his tale by relating his discovery of a neighbor's dog, which had been murdered with a garden fork. Because he likes both dogs and mysteries, Christopher sets off to find the killer, but what starts as a story about a dog becomes a story about Christopher's life. Not only do we learn about Christopher's many quirks, but also we learn the explanations for his seemingly irrational behavior, making it seem almost logical. The book is surprising funny, as Christopher, with his limited emotional range, makes the perfect straight man. As a psychologist, I found that the depiction of Christopher rang true, and overall, I found this novel to be a delightful, different, and quick little read.",r

"Antonio Bribiesca had a long, long career and played with all the greats of Old Mexico. Listening to this takes you back in time to the great music of the 1950's to the 1970's. This CD has some tracks solo guitar, some tracks have Mariachi and some tracks are solo. I recommend this wholeheartedly!",B
excellent CD... love it..,g
I like it,n
"I had this recording on vinyl when I was a teenager, and we learned most of the songs and sketches by heart. I still find them hilarious, but I can't guarantee that you will if you have no appreciation for the mimicry of Sellers and the skill of his writers. This is where I first heard 'All the Things you Are' sung by an old Londoner in his bath, with the Percy Faith orchestra there in the tub with him. Great stuff which brings back happy hours with the Philips reel-to-reel...",c

Reminiscing the good ole days. So long Kenny. Thank you for the music. Glad to find this!,\
I love just about everything Vikki Carr sings. The rating is not about her but the way a fragile item like this cd was packaged and shipped. Delivered with several cracks on the jewel case. Fortunately the cd was not damaged. Amazon needs to review its shipping policies.,V

"Bought because I loved Patsy Cline even though I wasn't that big of a country fan. What a surprise! Three great stars for one low price! And 9 awesome recordings!Got it home, played it and it immediately became one of our family's go to favorites!No, it's not all their big hits, but they very well should have been as there's not a bad cut to be had in the bunch.T. Texas Tyler, Webb Pierce and if course, Patsy are all well represented here with cuts that are engineered well and showcase each artists range of talents.I went into the Navy and when I came home my poor album had seen many visits to the turntable and was essentially worn out! Cover was falling apart and there was no inner sleeve to be found. It's taken me 35 years to find it again in decent condition.This time it will be covered!",A
"I've looked and looked for a complete ""best of"" or anthology collection of his works for years. This, so far is as close as it gets. Nice compilation (so far) with only a few missing. One day they'll get it right. But for now, this is the best you'll get.Unfortunately, Johnny was pushed in directions he shouldn't have taken. And forced, at times, to put out less than stellar collections of songs or arrangements that while pleasant, were not the best he could have done. Johnny is a class act with a gift! This collection offers the most of his best in one package. A great investment in worthwhile listening!",E
"It's a complete, classic, hit riddled slice of Bobby's recording career. We were so pleased at the quality, quantity, and complete collection of must have offerings from someone taken too soon. We miss you Bobby!",l

This is a classic! My third pressing! Just play it till I need a new one! Was so glad I found this gem on new vinyl!!!It has been available on CD and I have one of those.

At least we have this awesome recording to remember and honor them by.,W
Great Collection! I only bought this because my vinyl is in storage at the moment. I was presently surprised by the songs included and the order the songs are in. Makes for a great cross section of the career of this underrated incredible band.,k
"Gotta admit I was prepared NOT to like this LP. I got it for Christmas as a gift. Was I surprised.For his age, Neil's voice is in fine form and this is one of the better albums he's done is some time.It's as good as his earlier stuff when you could put on the album and the entire thing was great to listen to.I loved or liked every track and was surprised to find it in my player so often since the holidays. Out of allthe CD's I recieved as gifts, this one turned out to be the one I liked the best! And I ASKED for the otherones!!Good solid songs, good quality arrangements, with quality production from the folks at Capitol. Listeningto it makes me want to see Neil again in concert. I haven't been since the late 90's but, even then, he puton an awesome show!",a
An incredibly diverse collection of some older Christmas Classics as well as some newer soon to be Christmas Classic by current contemporary artists like Aimee Mann & Dianna Krall.

"Having been unable to find this issued on CD, I'm forced to listen to either a recording of this on a cassette of my vinyl (to keep from wearing out my vinyl) or the vinyl it's self. I'm not a big fan of downloads or manufactured on demand CD's either so...while I did download this, I don't think I'll be doing much more of it.I purchased the LP when it was first issued. The sound on the vinyl is 10 times better than the MP3 download but, it's better than nothing.After almost 40 years of listening, this is still one of my favorites by Steve Miller. While this isn't a ""top 40"" release, there are some great cuts on this LP. One half the LP is live, the other studio. The title cut (Rock Love) could easily been released as a single and probably would have done well for the time. I love all the blues cuts on the LP and while this is a pared down unit for Steve Miller, this LP will suprise you. With repeated listenings, I find it to be more and more one of my favorites of his and the only thing I find wrong with it is that it's one of his shorter LP's. With only 8 total cuts. Harbor Lights is probably my favorite cut but, honestly, there are NO BAD CUTS on this LP.",w
Received this and it is a very good CD.,J
"This CD is just wonderful.  I had a tape long time ago and have been looking for it for quite some time, and here it is.  The CD was recorded in 1965 but the music is so beautiful.  I love Gregorian and Orthodox chant.  The monks from Chevetogne sing both.  This one is a recording of the traditional orchodox vespers, and in the prayers you can hear the names of the king and queen of Belgium at the time.",G
"This is a reproduction of an older CD.  It contains work from Fuenllana, and pieces he rewrote for vihuela.  I love the voices of Nuria Rial and Carlos Mena, had seen the video on YouTube, and then found this CD. Most were very expensive, but this was at a decent price so I bought it immediately.  An absolute winner !",E
Very little to say - I just adore Orthodox service music and this is absolute favorite !,Q

"I've own this set since I seen it broadcasted on TV several years ago.  To the best of my knowledge the 2 cd set is no longer in print. The single cd just doesn't do the ""old dogs"" justice.  The songs are hilarious and you have to listen to the lyrics to catch all of the innuendos in the songs.  Such as ""ain't it hard when it ain't"" or ""she rather be homeless then be with me"". Then there are songs that ring true to life, ""music is hard on the living, but sure speak well of the dead"". It's about how everyone seems to critize the lifestyle of the famous but when they pass on they praise the artists.",y
Speaker rambles. Too many &#34;stories&#34; which make this drag on. His accent makes it hard to listen to.,w
"I was expecting this to be similar to Peter Furler's first solo album, but it is totally different. I guess I just miss his old Newsboys days--the Newsboys now are not the same without him, but I know things change. This is, however, a nice, slower, worship album,",S

"I'm not going to go into much detail on the actual World Domination CD, which is absolutely amazing. But talk about the blu-ray this version comes with. It's a live performance from their show at Shinkiba Studio Coast on November 23, 2017. The set list are: &#34;Choose Me&#34;, &#34;Don't You Tell Me&#34;, &#34;Moratorium&#34;, &#34;Puzzle&#34;, &#34;Cross&#34;, &#34;Matchless Gum&#34;, &#34;Awkward&#34;, &#34;Daydreaming&#34;, &#34;YOLO&#34;, &#34;Alone&#34;, &#34;Real Existence&#34;, &#34;Take Me Higher&#34;, &#34;Play&#34;, &#34;Secret My Lips&#34;, and ending with &#34;The Non-Fiction Days&#34;. Now... I understand you could simply overlook this band as some J-Pop gimmick niche group. Something along the lines of Babymetal, which I actually also am a huge fan of but for different reasons. But don't let the cute personas and maid uniforms fool you. Every one of the band members are extremely talented. I grew up listening to the hard rock and heavy metal of the 80s and 90s, and I associate their sound to the hard rock from back then. Especially in Kanami Tono's guitar, Misa's bass, and Akane Hirose's drums. Once you're able to look past the cute girls in maid costumes, these girls rock. That's not to say that Saiki Atsumi's vocals and Miku Kobato's rhythm guitar and backing vocals don't, but the real meat and potatoes of the band's rock sound are Kanami, Misa, and Akane. From Akane who pounds the skins with her double bass pedal/single bass drumming, to Kanami who shreds as good as most guitarists from my 80s rock bands, to Misa who plays her five-string bass like it's a damn lead guitar. I believe one thing that can throw people off from getting into Band-Maid is the feminine vocals, but I grew up with there being girl rock bands so I'm not effected by it, but I can understand. Besides, Saiki can go from j-pop sounding, to driving rock, to low and sultry. What's not to like? As for the concert.... if you're a fan of Band-Maid, the live performance is going to blow you away. Getting back to Saiki's vocals.... they were powerful and spot on. I think that's what I take most from this blu-ray is how incredible her voice is live. Also, if you're a fan, you're used to every track giving each member a chance to stand out throughout the song. No one takes a back seat in this band. And this concert was no different. Most songs have an extra little intro before the traditional song begins, from Misa and Akane driving in the next song's tempo on tracks like &#34;Real Existence&#34; and &#34;Play&#34;, to Kanami playing the piano before &#34;Daydreaming&#34; (unfortunately a pre-recorded intro. She wasn't actually playing it on stage but it was her) and having a back and forth between herself and Misa on &#34;Take Me Higher&#34;.... every song has a reason to make you glad you paid a little extra for the Limited Edition. That's not to say I don't have a couple complaints. Miku's mic.... it was way too low. You could barely hear her. And on a song like &#34;Alone&#34; that's known for her duet with Saiki it really stuck out. Saiki had to practically whisper to not drown her out. And there were a couple parts in the blu-ray where it seemed to fade out and then in between a couple songs. I have a feeling it cut out Miku's usual crowd interactions where she pumps up the crowd and is her usual kawaii Miku self. They may have cut those scenes to keep the flow of the blu-ray faster. If that is in fact what was cut I would have liked to have seen it regardless. But those are small gripes in the full spectrum of an AMAZING live show. Half the reason I bought this was because, living in the states, I knew I'd probably never get to actually see them live in person. More American venues really need to open up to these Japanese bands. You'd think they'd get the hint when seeing these bands sell out in record numbers wherever they do actually play.... but I digress. If you're a Band-Maid fan, and Amazon actually has these in stock.... I had to buy mine from Band-Maid's website... which was also $20 cheaper... BUY THIS LIMITED EDITION. You won't be disappointed.",R
Just love this CD I have four of their CD's and love everyone of them. Completely enjoy their music. Well worth the money.,V
Nice music. Arrived quickly.,i
"Came quickly, packaged well. Great music.",e
Love the songs.,]
"These are beautifully made and came with a nice quality chaplet card as well.  This is a powerful,  fairly quick chaplet to pray and much needed today!  The price is so much better than elsewhere and I am very pleased with my purchase!",R
Flanders & Swann are very entertaining . I am delighted with my purchase.,q
These women can really sing - I had heard a clip from them on a page I follow and wanted to hear more so I was elated to find this cd!,U
"What a refreshing change from the routine music that is being performed today.  Great rhythms, lyrics, and vocals. Who knew electronic dance music could be so versatile?",N
What was expected.,X
Good quality good music,o
"We've done this drive with a number of different audio tours - this one is by far the most entertaining.  The music is wonderful, and we bought a copy just for the songs.  I love maui!",Z
Love it great live performance from the great Tom Waits. There is not one bad track on the cd,C
"If you want of real taste of Alaska, buy this album. Alaska folk music at its best. It reminds us of our Alaskan vacation whenever we play it.",G
This was the age of the greatest group ever to hit the stage! I purchased this music fir the memories of the past! The music can’t be matched!,l
Alternative mix of Brainville and I love it,w
"I listened to this LP as a child, over and over again. I can still remember some of the songs and I am near 60 years old! These are just cute little songs for children without being tied to merchandise or comic books or T.V. shows.I would love to find this on CD for my grandchildren.",c
LOVE this CD! great music from very talented performers. Great gift idea for music fans.,e
"I have played this CD over multiple times and it has never failed to point my spirit and mind upwards (like all his other CDs, too).  I am often reminded of how the evil spirits left Saul when David sang unto the Lord whenever I hear Marty sing.  Marty is one of the very few singers out there who truly sings from HIS HEART unto the Lord, and not unto men -- and there truly is a big difference.",a
This CD has a wonderful collection of overovertures  I am very pleased with my purchase.  Never tire of listening to this great music.,_
Excellent condition,z
This was a gift for my husband.  He was happy and enjoys listening to the CD.  Great price on the CD also.,l
"First heard the title track on the radio in Washington DC in 1997, two years after it dropped. Immediately tracked down the CD and listened to it on the train all the way back to Southern California. Melodic, calming, evocative. I still listen to it.",l
"If you like the REAL music of the REAL Sons of The Pioneers, don’t buy this piece of over-produced crap! The Sons are drowned out by the soaring violins and the over-orchestration chosen by someone who is madly, stupidly in love with  ELEVATOR MUSIC . There is NOTHING REAL in this waste of plastic, money and time.",c
Playing soon,P
"The sound was very bad.  I have a new sound system, but this surprised me.",a
"Playing soon, new system",m
Getting ready to use.. music system just arrived,u
I had forgotten what I was missing in my music repertoire. Thank you Ms. Mitchell!,j
The CD ministers to me and love Babbie Mason's music.,d
"Great music.  Performers are impeccable, wonderful jazz solos, &quot;Sinatra&quot; big band style arrangements of Christian songs. FABULOUS chords and rhythms.  This cd will lift your spirits.",G
"I appreciate Michael Faircloth's work.  The hymn arrangements included are creative, varied, exhibiting immaculate pianistic technique and are recorded on a fine piano.  The clarity of the sound is great.  There are few pianists whose work is offered without being covered or supported by other instruments.  Michael's pianistic expression is enough in itself.  I would buy any new CD's if he offers them.",J
"Very appealing piano solo arrangements, very well played.  Michael has the clean technique of a well trained artist, but is also very creative.",y
"For the listener, the music is creative, a different take on hymn tunes.  I found it enjoyable.  I also have the printed piano book, and some of the tunes are written as chord charts, which I can use, but don't work well with my students.",\
"I get that they don't want to overwhelm Suzanne Giesemann's voice with the music, but it's too soft relative to her voice and since it's Hemi-sync music isn't part of the gain to be able to hear the music so you gain the benefits of Hemi-sync? If you turn up the volume to hear the music then Suzanne Giesemann's voice will be too loud. There was no sample track available on Amazon but you can go the Hemi-Sync website and listen to a short sample there. I would have liked just a Hemi-sync music track to meditate to as after awhile I image you will remember the meditations so the option of just the music would have been nice. This is part of a 4 CD set by Giesemann to support mediumship development. The 4 CDs are The Training Ground, Building the Power, Working with Your Guides, Making the Connection. This CD, Making the Connection, has 2 tracks slightly under 30 minutes each. At the Hemi-sync website you can purchase this and the other recordings as digital downloads for less than a physical CD and you can also purchase as a set. I didn't see the digital download available on Amazon. I decided to purchase the CD as I can pass it along to a friend when I am done using it.There is a simple guide booklet included, but you can get the same info and maybe a bit more watching some of the Suzanne Giesemann's videos and interviews at YouTube and she also explains her BLESS ME method on a video on YouTube as well. As with many CDs these days the CD does not come in a polystyrene case to prevent more trash in a the landfill that doesn't break down easily. It will arrive on a mostly paper case.You can read about the mediumship series at the websites for Suzanne Giesemann and Heni-Sync.Here is a copy of the description of this CD from Suzanne Giesemann's website as none was posted on this page:This 4th recording in the Mediumship Series by Suzanne Giesemann takes listeners to unlimited levels of connection in the spirit realms. The recording features two tracks: Track #1 is a guided meditation to help you learn to easily shift your awareness and vibration to meet those in alternate realities exactly where they are. Track #2 is mostly non-verbal, allowing you to have your own experience as the Hemi-Sync® frequencies assist you in reaching an expanded state.I hope this review helps you decide if this or any other of Suzanne Giesemann's CDs/digital downloads are for you. There are also some free materials at her website that do not require you to put in an email. I suggest visiting the Hemi-Sync website and listening to samples as well as reading the descriptions. Personally I am not interested in learning to do the traditional mediumship/channeling contact. I want to use some of the info expand my consciousness/awareness. I don't recommend or have an interest in contacting or channeling spirits or entities.",n

Brought back so many memories of my teenage years in London.  Couldn't listen to it for too long as I was unable to keep back the tears.  Fabulous CD!,w
"I've loved music all my life and have collected vinyl since the early 70's.  Later, when vinyl dwindled, it was CD's.  Lastly, it was digital versions that got added to the library.  As I've gotten older, I seem to drift back to earlier days and recently, Alice Cooper songs kept running through my head.  So....I wanted to add the CD version of their earlier albums.  No way to do that without including Billion Dollar Babies!  I was completed pleased with the quality of this recording and found the tracks to be clear with robust sound!  It was worth adding to the library and I've enjoyed listening to it.....LOUD!!",q
Love ALL of Paul Wilburs worship music. He is a favorite,]

I thought I was ordering the whole CD not just  single CD,r

Rich Little is great.,P
"This album is Grammy material. The worship is awesome and she has a voice just as powerful if not more powerful than Celine Dione. Love the live strings through out, gives the entire worship a different feel. Keep it up!!! can't wait to see what's next!",q

I love Ronnie Milsap and have been a fan of his for many years.  This is a rare version on vinyl and all of his songs are great.,D
"This only includes a smattering of Ronnie's greatest hits.  It has a few of his more obscure songs that probably should have been hits. There are 36 songs here, so you get quite a bit of listening time.  Most fans of his early country work more than likely already have these many times over, but still, you can't go wrong with Ronnie.  He has always had a wonderful, soothing voice and this set is no exception.  If you happen to be a collector of his work like I am, this is a must-have for your collection regardless.",n
This is yet another spectacular country album that Ronnie Milsap recorded for RCA.  The title track is full of his signature vocal crescendos.  Absolutely beautiful!,M
"This is a three CD set of Ronnie Milsap's greatest hits.  It's a great addition to the collection of any Ronnie Milsap or classic country fan.  You get 35 (out of 40)  of Ronnie's top country favorites here, all of which went to number one on the charts.",Q
Anything Sandi sings is beautiful ♥️Her voice is so clear and you understandevery word!!  ♥️,K
Heard this album many years ago and was sad to have lost it. Well now I have a new one.,T
Bought this as a baby shower gift for my Beatles loving son and his wife. Apparently newborn Penny likes it as much as they do!,M
"Talented artist.  I love the Beatles Covers, and he has picked out most of my favorites.  Can I request &#34;Yesterday&#34; make it on the next CD?",E
"The narrator is simply BRILLIANT.He is very, very good.He gets into the mind of each character he narrates and talks as they were experiencing it.Wow !",q
Best album ever.,u
Good to hear &#34;real&#34; country music again!  A real bargain!,E
Now my collection is complete.,p
an awesome collection of his greatest hits..,q
Great music,O
"I like this guy's guitar work - so the hard feelings aren't there. BUT...This is a TWELVE INCH EXTENDED PLAY 45.The two concerts the material comes from have not been issued on CD or vinyl before - I will be buying the material again to get the entire (or more complete versions) of the concerts.The segue into Hendrix's &#34;Third Stone From The Sun&#34; was what I bought the record for - I may have paid a bit too much for four tunes, but I got what I wanted (for now).",J
"CSN is better than 4 Way CD, which is a live concert.",A
A gift,N
Just discovered these guys a week ago.  Such infectious grooves!  I wish i would have found this band sooner.  This CD is packed with great jamming music.  I cant stop listening!!  This import's a little pricey but OMG Worth EVERY Penny.  I have not been so instantly addicted by a band in i can't remember how long.  So good.,O

"[[VIDEOID:66d6b825fffbb69e86f95ae570ba4a79]] My children are like me and like to sleep with some white noise. We all sleep with a box fan going, but the kids have a tough time falling asleep some nights. I put a small music player in the room and put in this CD. My youngest has been listening to it at every nap time and every bed time and loves it. The CD he had before was a bit loud at times so he either missed the music when we turned it down or got scared when the waves would crash a bit loud. This CD seems to have a good balance.It starts off with ocean waves and moves into soft music. It's soothing and goes on long enough that I simply press play and let the CD run through each time my little one needs to sleep. It has helped him sleep better than without music and he asks me to &#34;hit play!&#34; every time. We are happy with it.*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

"I'm not a big fan of novels about spies, secret operatives or hit men, but David Baldacci is one author who hasn't disappointed me so I decided to give his most recent book, The Innocent, a try in audio book format. The book was read by Ron McLarty and Orlagh Cassidy -- both did a great job.In this story Will Robie, is a hit man for the US government.  His targets typically are terrorists who are planning to harm or threaten the safety and security of others. He is very good at what he does, but there is something about a particular assignment he's given that doesn't sit right with him. He refuses to do what is expected, making him the hunted by those he works for.While Robie is on the run he meets a fourteen-year old girl named Julie Getty who is also running for her life Julie's parents have been murdered and she may now be a target herself.  Against his better judgment, Robie can't run away from her, but he has no idea what he is getting into.This story is fast paced and takes the reader on a wild ride. Numerous twists and turns had me paying extra close attention to what was going on. I found myself having to listen to a bit more and a bit more, finishing the audiobook much sooner than I expected to. There are some heart-pumping moments, and several sub-plots as well.  It's one of the books where you can almost imagine yourself watching the action. The sound effects used in the audiobook intensified this effect, and readers who read this one will be anxious to see how the story lines all tie in.",l
"Doing more by doing less is a seductive concept. But is it possible? Yes, says this how-to manual on essentialism. The formula for doing more by doing less is to discern what is absolutely essential, eliminate the rest, and get those things done with as little effort as possible writes author Greg McKeown. McKeown is CEO of a strategy company in Silicon Valley, co-created a course at Stanford titled &#34;Designing Life, Essentially&#34; and speaks at companies including Apple, Google, Twitter, Facebook, Salesforce, and LinkedIn.This book may not be for everybody. If your life is manageable, filled with satisfying activities, and you're progressing at the pace you want, you may not need this book. But for those who feel overloaded, distracted, stuck in the mire of doing a lot but not progressing on what matters to you, you might find it of interest. Although there are time and life management books by Stephen Covey, Brian Tracey, Julia Morgenstern, David Allen etc., this book approaches life management from a fresh angle: essentialism. It is filled with contemporary examples which are relevant in 2014.Four E's constitute the process of essentialism says McKeown: Essence, Explore, Eliminate and Execute. The goal is to do less, but better writes McKeown. It's a disciplined pursuit of less he writes. &#34;If you don't prioritize your life, someone else will,&#34; McKeown says. He recommends asking yourself continually: &#34;Is this the very most important thing I should be doing with my time and resources right now?&#34; Or, to discern what is essential to you, how about this question: &#34;If you could do one thing with your life right now, what would it be?&#34; The aim is to live by design, not default. You practice distinguishing between the trivial many and the vital few.Under the umbrella of each of the four E's of essence, explore, eliminate and execute, McKeown lists mindsets and actions to live more essentially. Take execute, one of my favorite sections, McKeown outlines: buffering - prepare contingencies and expect the unexpected, subtracting - bring forth more by removing obstacles, progress - the power of small wins which harnesses the power of steadiness and repetition, flow - capture the genius of the best routines, focus - figure out what's important now and be - the essentialist life of more clarity, more control, and more joy in the journey.Threaded throughout are abundant examples of individuals who live by the principles and actions described in this book. Warren Buffet seems to practice essentialism in his approach to investing about which Buffet says humorously: &#34;Our investment philosophy borders on lethargy.&#34; Doing more by doing less. There's the example of business prophet Peter Drucker who is quoted forecasting: &#34;In a few hundred years, when the history of our time will be written from a long-term perspective, it is likely that the most important event historians will see is not technology, not the Internet, not e-commerce. It is an unprecedented change in the human condition. For the first time - literally - substantial and rapidly growing numbers of people have choices. For the first time they will have to manage themselves. And society is totally unprepared for it.&#34; This book offers ideas on how to manage yourself and what is essential to you.Clarity = success promises this book. It makes sense that if you practice essentialist principles, it will revolutionize your life. You will create more of what you want, and eliminate more of what you don't want, enabling you to do more by doing less. This is life transforming, and one of the best books I have read recently in which the message is potentially life-changing.",w
"I am a big fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals. Cats contains the very well-known song &#34;Memory.&#34; Otherwise, there aren't many memorable songs in this musical. It also is a review, which means that there is no real plot.",n

"AIURa was a 4-frame comic series transformed into a 4 minute anime series. The OP and ED songs were great, with the ED sounding like a well done school anthem. This CD has four tracks, and only one of them is one I was interested in.Track 1. Extended version of the AIURa OP.Track 2. Unrelated song. Title 限りなく.... which my dictionary tells me is something unlimitedTrack 3. Karaoke version of Track 1Track 4. Karaoke version of Track 2If this had only two tracks, the OP and the ED, and no karaoke or extras, I'd have given it four stars, at least.As it is, Track 1 was very good, and maybe worth the import price if you _have_ to have it.",c

"These &#34;secret tapes&#34; are live performance recording that were either lost or never meant for distribution. First thing to know- though Sony has remastered the Tapes- they are old, of poor quality, meaning lots of hiss and noise.The Bach Concerto nr. 1 is familiar stuff to Gould fans. Sonically this recording with Mitropoulos and the Concergebouw is not much better than the Ottawa videos that are available on Youtube.  This is a live recording from the 1958 Saltzburg Festival.The Beethoven Concerto #5 op. 73 was recorded live with the Buffalo Philharmonic under Jospeh Krips. This often under-rated orchestra struts it's goods in a fine, sensitive performance. Though Gould is a bit noisy-  singing a bit loudly, even for him, I think it's one of Gould's best Beethoven's. There's even a bit of tenderness in Gould's playing- an approach not usually part of his playing.  I wish the recording were technically better.Last is Schoenberg's Klavierkonzert op. 42. While Gould is best known for his Bach, he was a great advocate of Modernists like Schoenberg and Webern (he made at least 5 additional Schoenberg recordings).Though the live recording, made with the New York Philharmonic in 1958 under the baton (again) of Dimitri Mitropoulos is very noisy(tape hiss and audience coughing), it's worth hearing for his very sophisticated interpretation of a difficult work. He was 26 when this recording was made.",D
"I was so excited for this series, because the Earworms website promises, ""brain optimized, accelerated learning."" I was really hoping for something revolutionary, like the [[ASIN:0596007124 Head First]] series of books. But, unfortunately, this is just a very mediocre introduction to Japanese. I was so disappointed.I bought the [[ASIN:1886447209 Rapanese]] cassette tapes over ten years ago, and they were goofy, but they taught me a little Japanese. I bought this CD excited to see what leaps Japanese instruction had made in the last decade. Sadly, that dated, wacky audio cassette was much more advanced than this CD.The 'music' is super cheap stock music, or elevator music. The voice actors talk in a little bit of sing-songy voices, but definitely not on beat with the music (the music was mixed in afterwards). You'll probably pick up more Japanese by reading the Wikipedia article on Learning Japanese, than you'll get by listening to this CD.The voice actors are by far the best part of this. With every other part of this, you'll wish you bought some other method of learning Japanese.Pros:+I liked both of the voice actors on this CD. The male actor has a nice British accent, and the female actor has a nice Japanese accent.Cons:-If you're looking for something that's revolutionary in any way, you'll be super disappointed-Super annoying music-Super annoying sound effects-Really bad sound mixing. The background music is too loud-The dialog is a rehash of every other beginning Japanese course ever written",A
"I purchased this record before leaving Phan Rang, Vietnam in October of 1967.  It is a documentary record which covers the ground war, air war and river war.  It is a ride back in time for me and lets me reflect on my life at the old age of 18 and 19 years.",h
"The first couplet of the first song begins:You've got a smile so bright, you know you could've been a candle.I'm holding you so tight, you know you could've been a handle.Anyone who has heard of the Temptations knows those lines from their classic ""The Way You Do the Things You Do."" It is crisply sung, almost doo-wop. It never loses its poise or falls into cliche.Most of these songs were hits. If the titles don't jar your memory, listen to the samples. Expect to know at least 10 of these.A couple weak links are present in ""Treat Her Like a Lady"" and ""Error of Our Ways."" In these two songs, there's no funk, no soul, and no depth. Both are acceptable, as pop R&B, but are musically pallid when compared to ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"" and ""Ball of Confusion.""The liner notes provide a puffy history, and credits song-by-song. That's not why this is worth buying. It is the sheer cool class and sway of the Temptations greatest hits. A couple songs might be left off, but most are here. Be sure to find the best price.1. Way You Do the Things You Do2. My Girl3. It's Growing4. Since I Lost My Baby5. Don't Look Back6. Get Ready7. Ain't Too Proud to Beg8. (I Know) I'm Losing You9. All I Need10. You're My Everything11.

It's a collection, and they did a very nice job of selection and order of the songs.Note that some of the songs are shortened from the originals, which is fine if you aren't expecting the original.  So this is a great introductory album.",m

"Carrie Jean Wharton has done a beautiful job composing these stories.  The stories are wonderful for all ages.  Anyone who has lost someone special and is grieving will find these stories very helpful.  The transitions from one track to the next are very well done.  Each story leads to another aspect of &quot;letting go&quot; of grief.  The grief process is not a simple thing, this CD offers a gentle approach to aid children in working through a lot of the issues that come with grief.",r

"David Cooks voice is like a rose among thorns. On this acoustic EP he takes several songs from his ""This Loud Morning"" album and does an acoustic version. When David does acoustic his voice is front and center and you get to experience the beauty of it full on. I love this ep, the only thing that would have made it better is if he had included ""Fade Into Me"" and ""Hard to Believe"" on it.If you don't have it by all means buy it. If it sells out here you can get it from that wal store or that tuney place.",E

"You don't have to be from the Hampton Roads area to appreciate Waterworks.  But I guarantee, it helps.  1994's release, Soul Divining, Waterworks provides 10 cuts of fairly decent music.  Leading off with Sarah, not to be confused by Sara from Starship's [[ASIN:B000YMOA64 Knee Deep In The Hoopla]], tells of the story of how she, Sarah, ripped out his heart and as any country song goes, &#34;stomped that sucker flat&#34;.Other songs such as Miles Away, the second cut, is a song of wistful yearning of wishing to be with the one they love to What a Fool, the seventh cut, talks about that fateful night he took away his girls virginity.  Soul Divining is a look inwards.  It's not pretty in a dreamy, lovey way but beautiful in the way introspective thinking is.This may not be for everybody and likely it's not.  It is for me and that's why I have it.",k
"If you knew nothing of Alpert, this might suffice. However, knowing what he is capable of and hearing this, they aren't one and the same. This isn't Herb's best at all!While the sound is definitely the master, the arrangements aren't at their best. Alpert is much better than this. However, his treatment of Sting's Fragile is a fantastic cover. Having heard this from a variety of musicians, this is very, very good.Go find some Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass to hear him at the top of his game.",o
Space Oddity is a MUST HAVE in just about any audiophile's library.  David Bowie pulls out all the stops in this album.  There's not a thing bad about it.,`
Birds of a Feather is exactly that when the listener understands this disc.  Everybody who plays on it is acquainted one way or another musically.  I got this when I was in my Larry Carlton mode.  There are definitely times when a disc like this is exactly what your CD player wants.Birds of a Feather is worth owning just for the mellowness it offers.,m
"Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon gives your stereo a workout.  This is what music is all about.  This is where compact disc has the serious advantage over vinyl.  You get to hear those high notes, those very quiet notes, the reverberation within a note.Dark Side of the Moon is a classic &#34;Must Have&#34; in just about any rocker's library.  The '94 &#34;upgrade&#34; to the original '73 release is a step forward.  Originally peaking at #1 in Billboard's Top Tapes and LPs, it again topped the chart in 1994 upon this rerelease.Dark Side of the Moon is a monumental accomplishment by one of the leading progressive rock bands of the time.",M
"Elemental is listed as McKennitt's first album originally released in 1985. The copyright date of my CD is 1994.Elemental is, as one reviewer notes, purely Celtic in style. McKennitt had yet to spread her wings and move into other styles of music to meld together as she is most known. Elemental is elemental. The element is the Celtic style. My favorite, Track 3, Yeats' Stolen Child is a song that locks in the mind in both sound of the notes and lyrics as the refrain calls away the child to the faeries.McKennitt's vocals are wonderful. She has the knack of making even the most mundane sound wonderful.",w
"You have to be in the mood to listen to this.  It's not bad at all, but it's likely not anything you'll just reach out and get unless you're in the mood for, as they said on Monty Python, &#34;... something totally different&#34;.Stephan Mikés is a sitar player who was based out of Miami and frequented the small venues in that area.  In 1996 I was down in Miami for school and happened to catch him at a coffee shop called Cool Beans Café.  He's interesting, approachable and I thoroughly enjoy the night and the music.  In fact, I bought both this and his other disc[[ASIN:B000CA7KWY Good the Bad & The Karmic]] that night.It takes something special to make this kind of music approachable to mainstream America.  I do believe Mikés was attempting to get it that way.",J
"I'd have to agree with the other reviewer.  Colors carries some weight based on track 6, Helios.  Beyond that, it's an interesting disc with an ambient sound that just could work for a quiet night.",_
"Few outside of Nova Scotia know of the group Signal Hill.  These guys, four of them, started out in Halifax playing covers of major hits.  They didn't do them identically, fortunately, as that really wouldn't have shown off their talent.  These guys are much like Crosby, Stills and Nash.  They have VERY tight harmonies.  And speaking of CSN, one of their covers on this disc is Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.Musical line up includes:Greg Tobin, Jason Campbell, Jason Meadus and Terry Chaplin.1.  Turn Up the Sunshine*,2.  Video Killed the Radio Star,3.  You Don't Have to Explain*,4.  Crackerjack Box,*5.  Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,6.  All Together*,7.  Clarity,*8.  Black Water,9.  Thank God I'm a Country Boy,10. The Sun Will Shine** - Original music by Signal HillIt was always quite a treat for me to see these guys play when I was in Halifax.  The Lower Deck, Halifax, NS, mostly hosted these guys.  Live recordings are out there and they convey the freedom and fun of the group.  They have a large local following who sing along with most songs.  It is a very entertaining thing, indeed.",`
"These songs are done decently enough that it could provide background music for a dinner party or such.  If you were in the mood for music while reading, this would also do the trick.These are all remakes, just as it says in the title, so if you do buy it, don't complain that &#34;these aren't the original songs&#34;.  That's because they AREN'T.",v
"The Manhattan Transfer is probably one of the best vocal groups - ever.  Their tight harmonies and honest camaraderie shows well through any performance or audio disc.Tonin' is a fun disc with Manhattan Transfer backing big names such as Frankie Valli with his hit, Let's Hang On.  Then there's Smokey Robinson and his phenomenal hit, I Second That Emotion.  The best, however, comes with James Taylor.  His treatment of Dream Lover is such that to hear it is to wonder why and how that wasn't the way writer and singer Bobby Darren had wanted it to begin with.Of all the Manhattan Transfer discs I own, and they number a lot, this is definitely my favorite.",G
"Shortly before his untimely death in February 1989, Roy Orbison completed this album, the 22nd of his career.  Orbison, no stranger to working with others, shares this album with the likes of Elvis Costello, U2, Albert Hammond, longtime collaborator, Bill Dees and his friends from the Traveling Wilburys, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne.Orbison's widow, Barbara, played executive producer upon her husband's death, ensuring both this album sounded the way he wished and making sure it was released.  There are no missteps here.  This is an album that was truly a labor of love and done with friends.Mystery Girl is as much as homage to his wife as it was just bits from the line of the song, She's a Mystery to Me.",L
"CTI (Creed Taylor Inc.) Masters of the Guitar, and yes, this is different cover from that other one offered, is a testament to guitarwork.  This was issued in 1988 with artist recordings ranging from 1974-1988 through CBS Records.  Creed Taylor, the label owner is also the producer of this album.This is okay music.  There's nothing here that's going to get the listener too excited.  It is decently constructed, produced and executed.  There are 11 tracks from 9 different artists.  George Benson and Kenny Burrell both share the honor of having two tracks each.If you're looking for something to use in the background for work or a party or even a gathering of sorts, this might well be a viable option.",o
"The Mamas & The Papas were a staple of California radio in the 1960s and 1970s.  16 of Their Greatest Hits represents pretty much anything you might want to hear from Cass Elliot, John Phillips, Denny Doherty, and Michelle Phillips.Folk music was the forte of John Phillips.  However, soft rock/pop rock was what the rest of the group were interested in doing.  Cass Elliot's voice proved to be one of the selling points of the group.  Her appearance also said, &#34;You don't have to be one of the 'pretty people' to be successful&#34;.Of all their music, and there is VERY MUCH that has been played for years, Creeque Alley is my favorite.  Creeque Alley, besides being a very harmonious song, is the story of the Mamas & the Papas.  The lyrics are a historical dialog of the who's who and how's and why's of the group.This is a fantastic album to own.  If you have nothing more than this, this is probably just enough to enjoy from the Mamas & the Papas.",D
"Johann Strauss is justifiably known for his waltzes.  Kids know the Blue Danube, even if they don't know its name.  Hum a few bars and they'll pick it right up.This disc, with a playing time of just over an hour, offers six of Strauss' most famous waltzes.  The disc starts with Blue Danube (10:54) and ends with Tales from the Vienna Woods (12:31).  The Vienna Opera Orchestra plays with Peter Falk - no, not THAT Peter Falk - conducting both Blue Danube and Tales from the Vienna Woods.  Carlo Rottini and Alfred Scholz also conduct.The music is exciting, happy and gay (and no, not THAT gay).  Waltzes have a habit of changing one's mood.  It's hard to be angry listening to one.",Z
"Unless you absolutely hate jazz, there's no reason you shouldn't give this a listen.  This is a great primer to the genre.  Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton, Benny Goodman and Peggy Lee are just some of the names on this 15 cut disc.With the exception of one cut, Sweet Georgia Brown by Benny Goodman, the album was recorded, mastered, mixed and released in full digital sound.  CDs at this time were hip to catching all those high and low notes which had been lost in the analog world.  This is the perfect way to get an idea of what jazz sounds like without throwing out a lot of cash.",T
"What do you get when you throw five of the greatest musicians of our lifetime into a recording studio?  You get &#34;The Traveling Wilburys&#34;.  As a lark and after recording a B-side song for George Harrison, in May and April 1988, Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, George Harrison and Bob Dylan shared writing and singing responsibilities for what would become The Traveling Wilburys.With Jeff Lynne's deft hand on the controls, ten songs were quickly recorded in the home of Dave Stewart (Eurythmics) and eventually released with Warner Brother Records.  You can hear Lynne's influence in many places with several songs seeming to be more at home with ELO than with this collection of artists.One of the things that was best about the Traveling Wilburys was they didn't really take themselves seriously.  They weren't there trying to pump out music in order to fulfill some contract.  Instead, what you had here were five guys who knew and respected each other having fun.",j
"Traveling Wilburys, Vol 3 is a huge mockery of a lot of things.  First, there was really no group formed as the Traveling Wilburys.  This was a joke in and of itself.  Second, and one of my favorites, I wonder how many people spent a lot of time trying to find Volume II?  There IS no Volume II.It is actually rather easy to mix up Vol I and Vol III.  The albums seem to have the same feel and some of the songs seem to belong on one album but not necessarily the other and that other might be the one it's actually on!  Vol III offers some really good cuts in the form of 7 Deadly Sins, Where Were You Last Night and Wilbury Twist.  The latter pokes fun at themselves, and in a small way, honors Roy Orbison.Having lost Roy Orbison in 1988, the Wilbury's changed up their pseudonyms and mixed up life a bit.  Dylan, Harrison, Lynne and Petty do their best to carry on.  However, I'm sure what started out as a lark became less fun with the death of their bandmate and friend.",s
"I could probably have lived without owning this disc.  However, have it I do.  I think the reason I did get it was because so much nostalgia was packed into these 21 songs.  Anka's young life definitely affected and shaped his music.  Who was Anka's babysitter?  Diana.  What was happening to him?  Puppy Love.Anka was a gifted song writer and musician.  That worked well for him and, really, the rest of North America.  He was &#34;every guy&#34; and, like it or not, those guys knew the words to these songs.Anka's 21 Golden Hits are certainly hits.  If you were to own only one Anka compilation, this would be it.  I can vouch for the one and only.",_
"This review is for the original Bona Drag, not the 20th Anniversary Issue nor the Remastered version.  Bona Drag gives us a good handful of Morrissey's early works.  Excellent songs like Interesting Drug, Last of the Famous International Playboys, Everyday is Like Sunday and Suedehead are all here.  If you've never listened to Morrissey, this is about as good a place to start as any.Bona Drag has 14 cuts on the original.  I think there was something between 17 and 20 on the Remastered version.  Well, that's remastered.  This is the way it was.",B
"Morrissey's Kill Uncle was Morrissey's second solo album.  This was not the music to which Morrissey was best known, but unlike the basher review, I've no malice towards either Steven Patrick Morrissey or this album.  (By the way, if you don't like him, why the hell'd you buy the album?)Morrissey, who I often refer to as the King of Gloom and Doom, is hardly such in this album.  That's partially why this album is so different than most.  Most people know Morrissey as the guy that could sing about death in a poppy manner.Kill Uncle is not bad.  But it's definitely not Morrissey's best work.",\
"Many years ago I was learning to copy Morse Code courtesy of the U.S. Navy.  I had known of Kraftwerk because of their first U.S. album release, Autobahn.  Radio Activity had Morse Code scattered throughout.  It was a &#34;must have&#34; for me because of it.However, it wasn't the only thing that kept me harnessed to the stereo.  Kraftwerk SOUNDED good!  They were a tight group of folks playing electronic music long before it was popular.  In fact, many give a nod to Krafwerk as pioneers of Electronika and, subsequently, techno-dance music.Perhaps my favorite album by Kraftwerk, and I HAVE been listening to them since the 1970s, Radio Activity always sounds fresh to me, regardless when I play it or whether it be vinyl or compact disc.If you like dance/club music, you'll like Kraftwerk.  If you like Electronika, you'll like Kraftwerk.  If you like Techo-pop, you'll like Kraftwerk.",j
"I used to live in Virginia Beach, VA.  I was the sous chef of a restaurant called Zia Marie when it first opened up in the 90's.  Among the staff was a guy named Mike Pio.  Mike was a member of OFS.  It was him who got me listening to OFS.Honestly, I can't remember much about the disc other than, well, I KNEW somebody on it!  Sadly, about 5 years later, the disc was in my Fiero at my apartment in Watertown, NY when it was broken into and a handful of CDs and my chef knife kit were stolen.Rock on, Pio, my sauté bro.",w
"In 1993 remember fondly waiting for this album to come out.  The radio station I listened to, 93.7, The Coast, WKOC (Norfolk, VA) told me of its release.  This station wasn't known for following the herd or leading ""Sheeple,"" it was ahead of the curve.My first listen to Truganini sold me on the album.  It told me the Oils weren't yet done with their work.  It told me offenses still waited to be set right.  It told me they, at least, would try to raise the conscienceness of a self engrossed people who generations earlier thought nothing of wholesale slaughter of others in the name of European white men and differences in the color of one's skin.I don't know how I knew at the time it also signaled the end of Midnight Oil outside of Australia with only the album Breathe to follow in 1996.Sadly, the Oils never received the worldwide success they so honestly deserved.  Hopefully during the years after their disbanding people occasionally think of the good they did through their music.  Yes, it was political.  Yes, it made ME think.  And yes, I miss them.",g

"Why is this CD so good? Well one of the greatest soundtrack artist, Craig Safan, composed it. Safan is especially good at adventures like John Williams. Safan made this great movie even better. I am a big fan of the 1980s movies. They were full of hope, light adventure, and a touch of comedy. I enjoy current movies too,  but I must admit they are mostly darker themes, with an apocalypse, zombies, foul language, and gore. So if you haven't seen this movie be sure to set aside some time for a rousing adventure in space. This reprint is excellent. Excellent quality CD, great price, fast delivery, well packaged, and reliable seller. I highly recommend getting this CD now. When this goes out of print it will double or triple in price. Being a fan of Remo Williams I had to pay more than double this price to get the reprint Remo Willams: The Adventure Begins CD because I waited to long.

"You know the old saying, &#34;Loved her, hated him?&#34;  Well, I don't actually hate him, but in my opinion Mark Lindsay's voice has not withstood the test of time.  Susan Cowsill has been a valued session musician for about 40 years and does a great job of carrying this CD.  She is really good and gets better every time she records.  Nostalgia is nice and sometimes people hear what they want to hear, but as a fan of Mark's for over 50 years I am very disappointed with his ho-hum performance on this CD.  Again, this is just one musician's opinion.",A

"The previous reviewer is no doubt much more qualified than I to evaluate the classical discipline of ""Etudes,"" and its value in the ballet studio (both apparently highly regarded).What struck me about the music I heard, were the feelings of modesty, warmth, and kindness conveyed by Ms. Gortiz's performances, particularly on those pieces where she appears to have created her own arrangements. Its as if her personality is sneaking out from behind years of classical training to wink at us, as she gently glides through technically challenging piano music.",i

"I remember when I worked at The Wherehouse Records in the early 80's, my manager always used to talk about Love Forever Changes and how it's this hidden classic. I never believed him and was always too busy to sit down and listen to it. Plus, I was into punk and New Wave and that psychadelic stuff was passe at the time. Well here I am, about to turn 40 and I'm positively transfixed by this new Remaster. I am listening every night when I go to bed with my portable CD player and still moved every time I hear it.The thing that blows me away about Forever Changes is the way it pulls you in. Upon first listen, you assume this is another late 60's peace and love album like Iron Butterfly or something. But as it grows on you, it begins to transcend it's own time. It's almost as if it could have been made in any era since and it would still have the same impact. This is one for the ages and I forsee myself playing it as much as my two other favorite late 60's classics Tommy and Velvet Underground and Nico. Thanks for this magnificent reissue.",j

"I must say that Toni Morrison is indeed one of my top three favorite authors.  When I first saw this movie at the time of its release, I must admit, I didn't really enjoy it.  I thought it was hard to follow in that format and the recollections disjointed.  The novel, however, especially Ms Morrison's reading of it is totally the opposite.  I am thoroughly enjoying it, soaking up the experiences presented, and recommending to anyone who will listen (no pun intended).  I will watch the movie again when I'm finished the the audio book, and I've already pre-ordered her upcoming novel. She is an inspirational author!",c

"I have just recently found Jim Smoak & the Louisiana Honeydrippers. This is a fantastic band which plays old style country music in a ~40s-50s  style partly emulating Bill Monroe and his Bluegrass Boys. (Not surprising since Smoak had toured with Monroe for so long.) Unlike the Monroe versions there is a strong fiddle during many of the songs and the mandolin is more subdued.The vocals are more reminiscent of country bands like the Carters than Monroe's bands. In most places the style is much closer to old time country than Monroe's style, Louisiana, Appalachian or Mississippi sounds. The lyrics are more upbeat than the sort of (whining ?) sound you see with some of Monroe's work and much other country music, nothing like the characteristic Stanley sound nor other 'bluesy' types of country music.What I especially like about the album is that there are a number of old songs you seldom find nowadays. These are songs like Liza Jane, Old Dan Tucker, Bill Cheatum, The Fisher's Hornpipe, Mama Don't Allow.",t
"This album is smooth but not at all low energy. The full moon ensemble takes old traditional gaelic music and makes it into modern love songs. Sweet songs are interspersed with light and lively fiddle tunes which would be equally at home in Dublin, the Isle of Skye or Galax Virginia. Track seven, Take Her In Your Arms will take your breath away! And it's just my current favorite,subject to change when track eight comes up.In some songs the fiddle is dominant, in others the vocals stand out, in most there is a nice interweave. Beautiful guitar supports and does not detract; and - a difficult conception in this age of overmixed drums - in none of them does the rhythm section lose  control. From time to time, is that a real Irish whistle? Bravo! Five stars!This is traditional music with modern instrumentation and with excellent recording and engineering. Mastering was at Swampers Sound Studio so it is not Lomax sitting in some dark cabin!",S

"As a longtime admirer of Maestro Corigliano, I purchased this recording quite a few years ago. If you are familiar with his film scores and previous orchestral works, you will not be disappointed with his Symphony #2. It is a rich, dark atmospheric work, written for an all-string orchestra. As always with Corigliano, it ranges from lyrical to discordant. Not an ""easy"" work, but well worthwhile.",Z

"A fan recommended this group to me' promising original scales.  I like Norteno music with traditional accordion waltz backing.  These guys have very fine harmony and the tenor lead is among the finest in the genre.  Why don't I rate this work higher?  Simply because I don't understand Spanish.  These are songs that follow a set pattern (for the most part, but with wonderful exceptions).  The big deal is to understand the stories and the allusions.  Absent that, most of the music is of a sameness.  Anglophones probably won't 'get it.'",M

"I was fortunate enough to have a neighbor who owned the complete set.  I was broke and recovering from bad accident, depressed, and having really tough time.  My neighbor said ""Just do it.  Won't cost anything but time.""  So I did just as it instructed.  Wasn't too sure if anything was happening.  One day driving long way to specialist, all of a sudden my vision became a complete blur.  Scared I was having a stroke, and out of desperation, jerked off glasses.  And to my surprise, perfect vision.  I had wore strong prescription glasses since age 6. That was all the proof I needed that this program was working and fixing stuff.  No more glasses for reading or distance at age 56.",Q
"Despite the big label elbowing of Philips and Gardiner, this is the true first recording of the quite magnificent Messe solennelle.  It is a live capture from 1993 at the Basilica or Vézélay, performed by no less than the Cracow Philharmonic and Choir under Jean-Paul Penin and splendid soloists, none particularly well-known, including the mezzo Christa Pfeiler who sings her difficult part admirably.  Kudos to the conductor who has complete grasp of the innovative power of this score. The first publicly performed work of the composer (who penned it at the age of 20) saw the “création” in 1824 at the élite church of St Roch (Paris).  This means it was contemporaneous with Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis and actually preceded the last masses of Schubert.  The Missa Solemnis is of course a work sui generis, but the sheer originality of concept, sound world and variety of expression of Berlioz’s work far outshine the conventional Haydn-flavored works of Schubert.The sound capture of this live session is admirable in all respects, without the stepping into the world of aural calibration of the Philips. Above all, this remarkable issue captures the live frisson of the live event — irreplaceable in my imagination.",W
"Even among the tens of superlative (and increasingly rare) discs Paul van Nevel and the Huelgas have made of early music, this Dufay disc is a standout.  Isorhythmic motets are compositions which free melodic lines are overlain on repeated rhythmic patterns (usually in the tenor) -- this increasing freedom points directly to the sixteenth century.  Dufay's works carry this concept to their height.  As van Nevel eloquently states in his liner notes, these works are a ""symbolic farewell"" to the medieval musical world (ars nova).This irreplaceable disc has complete text and translations.  Even more striking, the cover photograph an exquisite image looking upwards into the cupola of Santa Maria Novella in Pesaro.  You may humbled to realize that art and music have not made any essential progress after five centuries.",e
"Premières valses (1899) are charming,  turn of the century morceaux; the selection from le Rossignol éperdu (completed 1910) shows an ambitious advance in harmony and technique and bears rehearing.Beautifully played by Mme Joly and captured in perfect sound by Accord. Another production of Georges Kisselhoff.",I
"Another excellent recording from the Motette label, here capturing the exquisite Steinfeld (Rheinland) Basilica organ of 35 stops and 1,956 pipes.  Many of the tiniest pipes (&lt;2') date from around 1600, while the largest pedal pipe (16') is a restoration of 1934.  Craig Cramer of Notre Dame plays an appropriate and unhackneyed Bach program (Prelude and Fugues BWV 531 and 542, the Partita Variations BWV 768, and the three 'Allein Gott in der Hoh sei Ehr' chorale preludes which exemplify his unlimited skills and the greatness of this music.",e
"This is the second volume on CD of recordings made by Spanish Columbia (released later on DeccaLP) and even more difficult to find than the first.  But the rewards are immense as this was made at the zenith of the Caballe's power (1974) before her enormous expansion of roles in the lyrico-spinto repertoire at the greatest houses on three continents.  As such, the purity and flexibility of the 60s is evident, but also the incipient power and dramatic qualities of her later career.Noteworthy are arias in three roles in she did not appear in on stage: Gilda, Suor Angelica, and Amina (Sonnambula) --- and they are sung to perfection with ideal accompaniment by Gianfranco Masini (who conducted some superb live recordings of Caballe in this period, all imperative listening).  Arias from concurrent stage roles include the Trovatore Leonora, Amelia, and the two striking arias of Vepres Siciliennes.Although there is considerable overlap with other aria albums of this period (EMI, RCA etc), the Suor Angelica lament is truly special.",W
"A powerful realization of this masterly work of Puccini — is there any doubt that Trittico is far more difficult to cast and produce in the theater than anything work in the standard Italian repertoire? And its rewards are commensurately grand.This rendition features excellent singers in all the three leading roles — Tokody is superior in sound and manner to the late-captured Price whose voice (if were a barge) would sink.  Unfortunately, she failed to fine the voice down for her Angelica in the sister recording. But Casellato-Lamberti is the equal of Domingo and Nimsgern is excellent. Even the Frugola is cast with a real voice instead of a crone’s. Prêtre is completely convincing and the sound is spacious and well-captured.  The four language libretto in full sends this to the top of my flagpole of the versions I’ve encountered, including the famous Santini.",Y
"Wagnerians look back to the 50s and 60s —Verdians acclaim the 70s justifiably. Evidence lies in this live capture from 12/18/77 led by the redoubtable Muti, and studded with stars such as Cossotto, Manuguerra, Carlo Cossuta, and in very good broadcast sound from the 2000 seat Teatro Communale. At the head of the ledger is a soprano who is hardly remembered despite starring at the Met for some 158 performances, where she was much appreciated  — simply because she was not invited to make any commercial (studio) recordings.What we hear is a voice of lustrous beauty throughout its range (which could hardly be said of many of her rivals such as Price and Scotto); exquisitely fine-grained despite it ability to expand to spinto power, and a technique of flexibility and accuracy (she tried to sing what “è scritto”, and sometime Muti is unforgiving as he’s used to Leonoras who smudge their fiorature).  One hopes that when a Mexican soprano anywhere near this calibre appears, the studios will have changed their attitude.So the three key reasons for acquiring this recording (also available on at least one other release) are Cruz-Romo, Cossotto (in typically wonderful form), and Muti (who does not allow any interpolated high notes by the tenor). Carlo Cossuta is quite fine as Manrico (certainly better recalled for this rôle than Otello). Under no circumstances can Muti’s later release (in modern studio sound), with its superannuated principals be considered at all competitive to this rendition.It’s ironic that the Trovatore recordings that give me the most respect for the opera are both live recorded with superb Leonoras: Cruz-Romo and Caballé (a different characterization).  I would not dispute another Amazon reviewer of this recording issued on a different label who has called this the finest Trovatore on disc.",i
"This 1986 recording, dedicated to the later organ works of this great composer better known for his large scale works as the Weinen Klagen variations — without which it is difficult to imagine Franck’s creations — is wholly admirable is all respects. The contents include a selection from the inestimable Via Crucis and the Missa Pro Organo (from the same year, 1879) and are played to absolute perfection by the young Bousseau on the St Pithiviers organ outside Paris. This sweet sounding instrument from 1786 was refurbished by Cavaillé-Coll a century later, and by Robert Boisseau in 1962. A marvelous disc with the highest recommendation.",J
"This exquisite disc featuring six Provencal organs features several of the eminent organists of the 6-disc box referenced above, and in slightly duplicative repertoire.  At the nominal price and the wingspan of the box (from Switzerland to the Balearic Islands to Spain), I would advise acquiring that set first and supplementing with disc.Or, alternatively, if the set is too expansive, then this disc can serve a standalone window on French Mediterranean organs. Besides the two French organs played by Michel Chapuis (St-Maximin la Sainte Baume) and Rene Saorgin (Malaucene) in the set, this single disc includes four other organs in pieces by Couperin, Roberday and Frescobaldi by, in addition to the organists just named, Francois Chapelet and Lucienne Antonini.  A disc to delight those who have traveled to Provence, or those who wish to be transported to the living past.",J
"These two works are early Debussy rarities: l'Enfant prodigue (1884) won the composer the Prix de Rome and la Demoiselle elue (1884) fulfilled  a commission related thereto.  This disc is also unusual in that the soloists gathered  in the former work likely never appeared together in any other recording:  Jessye Norman, Jose Carreras and Fischer-Dieskau.  L'Enfant contains an oft excerpted work (Air de Lia) but otherwise the 35 minute work is obscure, as is the 20 minute Demoiselle. All soloists (including Cotrubas in Demoiselle) are in fine vocal estate; Carreras  shows little evidence of the stylistic proposition he faces, tending to scoop and sob in Italianate mode, but his voice is in its prime.  The studio sound is excellent, and full bilingual texts are included (in microfont); unfortunately, the disc is banded in single tracks for each work.  An essential recording for fans of significant French  fin-de-siecle music interpreted by four luminous singers of the era.",q
"As an owner of many vintage recordings, the sound on this set is marginal. With so little music actually coming through, this interesting (but not altogether convincing) early middle period Verdi is heavily cloaked and perhaps only some of the arias come through with dramatic effect. Extensive cuts to the Paris ballet music.  For those unfamiliar with the work, It's recommended to choose a modern recording (Arroyo/Levine, Studer/Muti) to grasp the basic musical detail of Vespri.",G
"This is a live concert performance in London in 1973, duplicated on the Opera d’Oro release (for which there is a fine, in depth review which is worthwhile). I would add that that the CD format is ideal for listening to this work is scarcely warrants a production in our time. The two CD recording omits perhaps 25% of the score, including ballet music (no regrets) but a soprano duet might have had some interest. As a whole, this music is a characteristically  melodramatic and bombastic and mostly forgettable (not to speak of the repulsive plot).Tucker is a few years from his untimely death and the sound is solid but typically rather nasal and elderly sounding (suiting his part naturally). The other tenor Leopold (a high flying part) is sung convincingly by Juan Sabate.  Perhaps the best reason for a listen is to Hayashi’s Rachel (la juive) — who sings very well with a clean technique and clear timbre. Very little of her career is documented.  Michelle Le Bris sings a powerful Eudoxie.",f
"There is almost a surfeit of excellent contemporary renditions of the partitas on the piano (the only way I enjoy hearing them) but this is a distinctive classic.  For the connoisseur or pianist, these interpretations of the largely forgotten Carl Seeman (1910-1983) are treasures. The purity, precision, fine rhythmic sense, and sheer fleet, pianistic brilliance on display here provides a window into a different performance tradition.  The fingers do it all — no octave emphasis/doublings in the base, minimal pedal, true legato, no détaché  — without agogic or rubato effects. This is less “romantic” playing than dominates today’s recording studio, but the uncovering of the composer’s creative world is exceptional and never tires.  The recording is close but fine in every way.",c
"This recording encompasses four settings of the five movement 'propre de messe' for the Advent/Christmas period as sung at, and by the monks of the celebrated Monastery of Montserrat (outside Barcelona)  with its famed 'Black Madonna', and for whom the late, great soprano Montserrat Caballe was named.  A remembrance for those fortunate to have been to this prepossessing site (alas, not me), and otherwise a contribution to the lineage of a precious heritage.Published by the label Jade in 1990, the disc timing is about 52 minutes, and contains fine textual notes in French and Catalan.",I
"This is a treasurable recording (2002) of the complete Durufle organ solo works as played by the superb organist Erik Wm Suter of Washington Cathedral. The audio capture of this 10,650 pipe Skinner instrument  is exemplary, as are the notes by Mr Suter.  Kudos to all involved in this memorable “On a Sunday Afternoon”.",w
"This remarkable 1972 recording is outstanding on many levels (including the excellent sound recorded in vivo) but above all for the superlative principals.  Caballé was in her early prime and connects technically and dramatically with the heart of the role of the queen — even later, Verdi never surpassed the anger, despair and nervous energy of her final aria and finale. While we are fortunate to have  Caballé live in 1977 from Aix (with Carreras), her voice here has a unique, youthful beauty (indeed, it is the youngest sounding Elisabeth on record).More surprising to me is the superlative Gianni Raimondi — ten years senior to Caballé) but scorchingly dramatic and perfectly executed with a voice of true, unpressured beauty. A pity the studios ignored him for, to me, he had a finer combination of plangent Mediterranean timbre and power than any of the Big Three who followed him (Pavarotti came closest). Raimondi also sang very difficult roles, including the high-flying heros of Puritani and Guillaume Tell.The mezzo Sara, sung by the (unknown to me) Laura Londi, is very fine  — what hidden talent the Italian opera houses of the day cultivated.  Bartoletti is somewhat less dramatic than Rudel, but the balance inherent in dramatic lyricism is well guided.",i
"Scherchen is truly incandescent in this astonishing score, and captured in amazing fidelity. I had never particularly liked this music, but listening to Scherchen’s reading has altered my perception and I’m in search of his other Berlioz readings.",x
"This is a review of the pictured recording, made in Bayreuth in situ in 1962. All previous reviews are not for this recording.This Lohengrin carries the special electricity of live performance but also reflects a time where the spiritual qualities of the text and music were respected and carried no 'commercial' prospects.At the heart of Lohengrin is the tragedy of Lohengrin and Elsa.  If the protagonists fail to convince, the drama fails. In the youthful Jess Thomas and the 22-year old Anja Silja, the recorded history of this opera reaches its pinnacle. In pure and translucent tones, these singers convey the vision of this mystical opera. The sound of Elisabeth Grummer in the Kempe studio EMI release, widely praised, has nothing like the youthful suppleness and tonal refulgence of Silja -- a matronly sound is far from ideal. Many other praised collaborations (e.g. Domingo/Norman) succeed in musical, but not dramatic, terms. Sawallisch is very fine, the Bayreuth acoustic is well-captured, and a complete [old-style] booklet with text and translation is luxuriously supplied. This is my favorite of my six Lohengrin versions -- and I'm chagrined to say that I bought it last for no clear reason.  Although the catalogue is overflowing with fine and very fine Lohengrins -- all worth hearing for some interesting singer, interpretation, conductor -- in a world of unlimited musical operatic masterpieces, and limited time, I'd advise to start here.",l
"A very fine disc in every way that showcases the superb skills of Soviet musicians including excellent but lesser known violin and saxophone soloists; Alexeev is better known through his non-Melodiya recordings. Fine sound, additionally, render this an admirable collection of Glaxunov's concerted work.",i
"The proverbial 'gem', an engaging -- even masterly -- work of German 'verismo'. Though I cannot compare this reading  against another recording, and despite the absence of libretto, the score's striking thematic and melodic materials paint an evident dramatic situation that drew me immediately, from the very striking opening bars to the final chords.The first tier soloists (no less than Kollo, Marton, Moll, Weikl) clearly passionately believe in this work and absolute credit is due to Janowski for his leadership of this fine band and cast.  Although there is no libretto, there a very fine trilingual notes on the work and the soloists. Recommended strongly for aficionados of operatic history and true music lovers.",d
"This rendition has every virtue and no faults whatsoever, and is unexcelled in modern recordings by baritones, enhanced by the superb plasticity of Ax's pianism.With so many competitors, of whom Goerne is perhaps the most formidable, why so? First, Hagegard's timbre here at its prime is uniquely beautiful, more youthful and with tenor-ish overtones which enhance the reading for me as it binds this last collection to the poignant heroes of Mueller in and Winterreise. Second, his voice, which otherwise resembles the early DFD in luster, has absolute evenness in the lower reaches and in alt -- and expands thrillingly and fearlessly without the least loss in quality. Third, the unaffectedness of Hagegard's reading strike to the central core of this wild, even passionate collection of songs. At this supreme level of musicality, there is no need for the agogic emphases of Terfel, Bostridge or the later DFD. Goerne's very fine reading is darker, and Trekel has not recorded this [yet], this remains surpassed.",r
"Repertoire, performance, engineering and liner notes -- beyond first class. Refer the comprehensive review by g c for details. The essential open air disc for warm weather sally in the countryside  with the top or windows down.",z
"This is one of the finest mementos of the late (1994) Richter, playing a very long program of works that were composed within a window of 20 years or so in the late 19th century.  As such, it was clearly a program that was close to the heart of this iconic pianist, and we can participate in this live performance in very fine sound (Lugano).  As Piero Rattalino points out in his moving program notes, this final stage of Richter played out in minor venues, almost at the spur of the moment, manifesting a withdrawal from public life.  There is a concomitant austerity in the performances which have a monumental quality (Rattalino hits the nail on the head when he says they are 'hieratic').  Although these compositions were performed and recorded elsewhere in Richter's long lifespan, this disc is indeed privileged.The Schwetzinger recital recorded by Hanssler disc is the same recital. The Aura has the advantage of Rattalino’s wonderful notes.",a
"Assuming that performances of lieder recitals in general and Wolf specifically are steadily diminishing (at least outside German-speaking countries), this recording could very well represent the golden age of Wolf performances. Very sensitively performed by Seefried and Werba, this misses the fifth star by virtue of my reaction to Seefried's voice -- fine when not under pressure in terms of volume or above the staff -- but colorless and thin at many climatic moments. I suppose this is just the inherent drawback of the 'white' Germanic voice type.",\
"I bought this because I have all Angel's other CD'S and have worn them out. I attended one of her concerts in Delanco NJ & was elated with praise. Got the concert CD. Now with this CD I am hearing new & some old, songs.What a voice & blessing Angel has been to my life. I first heard her at my church, Christ's Bible Church, where she still sings.If you read this Angel, thanks for all you do & the blessings I still get from your singing. I would love to go to another of your concerts so if you could let me know & I'm familiar with the area, I will try to attend.",e
Beautiful Album-True Spirit of the SW.  Rick Brosseau has the voice of an Angel and has recorded several other CD's since this album.  You cannot go wrong with this one! (My Husband!)  Enjoy!,h
"I was a little hesitant to order the cd because so many of the hymns I was not familiar with. I was most pleasantly surprised after I listened to the cd a couple of times, because almost all of them now are my favorites! My husband and I enjoy this cd very much and play it often at night before bedtime, as we find it not only spirit-uplifting, but relaxing as well.",V
"I purchased this set when it was released in serial format, and this CD was the first one.  We loved the music and also the commentary that accompanies the CD. Unfortunately, it was used so much at our house that it eventually disappeared, making it necessary to replace it.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price.I have always liked the sound of classical music but it was a sort of foreign language that I didn't always understand - this set gives some background on each track so that the enjoyment of the music is enhanced.Volume 1 is light, pleasant and a perfect place to begin.  The music is enjoyable and the case is colorful and informative.My only criticism is that the CD isn't securely affixed into the booklet/cover and it was constantly falling out when the album was handled.  This led to the CD being damaged and eventually being lost completely - that is why I had to buy another one.  I have compensated for this situation by downloading the music CDs to my computer and then filing the CDs into a protective album, leaving the booklet/covers accessible when someone wants to refer to them.  Now, when we want to listen, we simply plug our computer into our stereo system and read the accompanying booklet.",E
"I love this book, and this program helped me recover from serious disease.  You should be careful when buying it though, because third party vendors tend to sell this for TOO MUCH MONEY.ABOUT THE PRICE:  This same product is offered on Doug Kaufman's website for $69.95 + shipping. (I think I paid only $10.00 shipping, making the total $79.95.)  The paperback print version is exactly the same price as the audio trilogy (and it is worthwhile to own both).  I have seen it sold by third parties for up to $150.00 + shipping, and I think that is outrageous!  If you shop directly from Doug Kaufman's website, you might save almost 1/2 the cost.  If you buy it from Amazon, or another third party vendor, it is possible that you could get a slight discount OR you could pay a mind bogling premium - depending on the seller.  Just be aware of the true retail value of this product, and you can make an educated decision about the value of the item being offered.ABOUT THE PROGRAM RESULTS:  Having said that, it is a great book and still worth the cost of purchase even if you paid top dollar.  After 4 months of using this program, my type 2 diabetes disappeared, and I had lost 40 lbs.  The weight loss was shocking because I hadn't weighed in several months - wasn't really trying to lose weight and was only trying to normalize my blood sugar.  I began to notice that my clothes were loose, and when I went to buy new ones, I had gone down a size.  That is when I decided to weigh myself and see what was up. Very pleasant surprise!  Plus, I was free of a myriad of other symptoms.His theories are scoffed at by the mainstream medical community, so if your are a medical conservative, you might want to pass this one by. However, I highly recommend them for anyone who has tried the conventional route and failed.  If you are ready for a change, and not afraid of some detailed medical information (with the sources to back them up), then these are good books to read or listen to in their entirety, and to have on hand for future reference.  The dry medical data is broken up with real life stories of people who were able to relieve themselves of a host of health issues, simply by changing their diet (and sometimes taking antifungal medications).  This makes the books much more accessible and easily readable.ABOUT THE DIET PLAN:  This is an easy to understand and easy to follow plan.  Although it is lo carb, it is not like Atkins or the other lo carb diets out there.  It is specifically engineered to kill fungus in the system.  The set includes a program booklet, complete with foods allowed and not allowed on each of the three phases of the diet, and a full week's menu plan.  It is not a starvation diet, but very low in carbohydrates, with the carbs increasing gradually as the patient advances in the program.  The program advocates freshly juiced veggies in addition to the rest of the diet.  I ate a lot and was satisfied - sometimes I got depressed about the amount I was eating because I was already overweight and thought I must be gaining.  That is why I avoided weighing myself. The weight loss was a HUGE surprise!  I found out that good health and not diets produce weight loss and lean muscle mass.Unfortunately, I slipped out of my good habits, and both the weight and the disease returned.  Now, I am back on the program and doing great.  This time I know what can happen if I let my guard down, and will never go back to a sugary, carb based, fungus feeding diet again.  The lapse back into diabetes and obesity was my own fault and not the fault of the program or it's authors.I really hope this information gets out to the general public, as it doesn't seem to be a well known book.  Just be sure to buy it at a fair price.",e
I love this CD. It is soothing and wonderful for anytime the stress level needs to come down. People with children or high stress jobs will love this. A cup of tea and some lotion for massage will round out a good 20 minute stress reducer.,w
"[[ASIN:B01EUC2RG8 Fast Tracks For Men, 2.4 Fl. Oz. / 70 ml - Inspired By Ferrari Cologne]]I was looking for new scents or signature scents for my fiance and wanted to try this cologne. I like and appreciate the scent of Ferrari cologne so I thought maybe my fiance (Bobby) would like to try it. This is a way for us to get an idea of what a scent smells like with Bobby's chemistry without spending a lot of money and then not like the scent of it. If he likes it then we can continue purchasing it. The seller delivered very quickly and we received packaged well. Since this cologne is an Eau De Toilette Spray, it will have slightly more of the oils (10%) that make the spray smell great than just cologne which has about 7% oil. The scent also is delivered in a convenient spray which me and Bobby both like. The cologne actually smells very nice on him. It's a sort of a fresh woodsy, masculine scent and you can definitely smell a hint of lavender and cedar in it. Ferrari describes the scent as &#34; notes of mint and lavender with pepper, black tea, and lebanese cedar to create a memorable scent that weaves distinguished with daring.&#34; Some of those things I have no idea what they smell like, but I'd say this not really a musk based scent but it smells great on Bobby. It's still strong enough scent with about three or four sprays being all he needs. As far as wear, it lasts a pretty good while. It's a nice manly in it's scent and he said he received several complements on the cologne. It is also a large bottle at 2.4 ounces delivered to the door for under 11.00. We like the cologne and can recommend it. I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. The discount I received will not alter my honest opinion in any way. Since I count on honest product reviews to make my selections on Amazon, I will always be forthcoming and sincere in all my reviews.

"Mr. Wronski had already retired from the performance world when he was in the U.S., where he taught for a few years at Indiana U. in Bloomington.  He was a brilliant man, very analytical of technical difficulties, and very inspiring for musical ones.  Fingerings and shifting are still way ahead of the times, and provide excellent solutions to thorny pieces like the Berg.  While this album is not recorded with the kind of equipment we have come to expect today, it clearly demonstrates that he was a first rate performer, and gives interesting insights as to how these pieces were being interpreted behind what was then the Iron Curtain.  He was the Rector of the Warsaw Conservatory, and told us that there, every aspect of the students' lives was guided by their teachers, from how often they went out partying or on dates, to when they had to start abstaining from alcohol before concerts, and so on. Of course, each teacher only 'supervised' three or four students for their work load, and their job was to turn them into marketable artists. Quite a contrast from the 'Henry Ford' approach used in schools in the US today!  The recording is a unique and fascinating glimpse into a different world of performance practices.",x

"the two prior reviews for this album indicate the two types of responses people are likely to have to this album -- some will just hear it as noise, while others will hear it as wonderful layers of beautiful bliss.  this isn't standard shoegaze... it's for people who appreciate big gauzy squalls of feedback and wisftul, barely-heard vocals, all held together by a semi-structured sense of melody.",J

"I got a copy of this single from my parents when I was a child around 1970.  I have no idea how they came to own it to pass it to me.  Unfortunately it has since been destroyed but I do have a tape recording of it and I managed to get a digital copy from the original 45 I owned before that happened.  It's a surreal experience listening to the two tracks, ""In 1967,"" and ""Catwalk.""  To this day it's my favorite record.  If I could afford this seller's price I would most certainly buy it.  It's truly a unique experience.",L
Awesome worship music,I
Love it.  Thanks seller!,x

".Scoring:5 stars:  Star Wars Fans - MUST SEE!1 star:  Non-Star Wars Fans - Don't Bother!0 stars:  Younger Children - Mom's be careful, too scary!4 stars:  Stuck-in-the-Middle Star Wars ViewersSummary:Simply, another great hit for star wars fans!  Filled with great movie technologies, great action, good script-writing, good acting, very good directing, and all those symbolic and instructive details that requires you to watch the movie 20 times to catch the story's subtle underlying themes. Truly another Star Wars movie that changes Hollywood and its technology!Review:While darker than Episode I, it continues to fill in the questions that are left in our minds, including how someone with the promise to do so much good (Anakin Skywalker - Hayden Christensen) can become trapped by evil.  (How many times do we fall prey to these same issues?)One aspect of Lucas' genius is that we have waited almost 25 years to learn many of the underlying story drivers from the first movie.  Our curiosity drags us back searching for little details of the ""force"", Skywalker's beginning, Yoda, Jedi Knight' motives,Lucas's digital film making and THX are dramatic, eye catching, enthralling, and bring the movie to new levels of entertainment.  (Where would Hollywood be today without George Lucas and his technology?)The script has been attacked by many critics, but is a sure winner with the fans!Story:Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader-to-be (Hayden Christiansen) is sent investigate attacks and protect Senator Padmé Amidala's (Natalie Portman) who struggles against the creation of an army by the Galactic Republic.  The Anakin's relationship with Amidala blossoms while it sours with his domineering Master Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGreggor).Negatives:Ok, there are some dialogue weaknesses within Skywalker and Padmé Amidala's (Portman) love story.And, the movie is darker than some movie goers probably want.Scare Factor:Don't bring your younger children to this one: Episode I was made for younger children, this one is darker and therefore more fierce-some for the little ones.",G

"Yes, I am being just slightly hyperbolic, but only a little. This recording, made in 1957 and re-mastered exactly fifty years later by United Archives, received a Diapason d'Or but does not seem to have caught on all that much with the listening or reviewing public. This is truly unfortunate, because it is an amazingly impressive traversal of Brahms' First, one of the pinnacles of the Germanic symphonic repertoire. In fact, as a great fan of this work, I am inclined to declare it my official choice (as of now) for reference recording. It would make a fantastic introduction to the symphony or the composer, and if you are even a diffident collector of Brahms Firsts, there is no excuse not to acquire this recording.George Szell, as leader of the Cleveland Orchestra, has a reputation for clear, balanced, swift, and &#34;classical&#34; readings of standard repertoire, and while those adjectives apply here, this performance can certainly not be reduced to them. It is also tough, propulsive, precise, dramatic, and even aggressive at moments. Accents are precise and marked in a way that will be familiar to listeners immersed in today's historically-informed approach to Romantic works, but unlike those readings, it never sacrifices long-term architecture for momentary payoff in articulation. Overall, the sense here is of a single line; the tempi are consistent and steady (but never inflexible), and the music is always going somewhere. Szell and his instantaneously responsive Clevelanders never tread water, never waste a phrase: everything is in its place, and the structure of the symphony is beautifully revealed.Above all, to my ears, the trap in Brahms is to indulge in his dense scoring and let everything become soupy and indistinct. In fact, the music will often sound reasonably passable even when presented by a conductor who fails to clarify all of the mid-register lines and subtle rhythmic elements. This is a testament to Brahms's compositional skill, but the effect of the music in the hands of a conductor and ensemble capable of presenting his work with perfect clarity is astonishing and revelatory. Szell/Cleveland, particularly on this recording, is just such a collaboration. If all performances were of this standard, Brahms would not be thought of as a &#34;muddy&#34; composer or orchestrator. This does not, however, mean that Szell's reading of this symphony is &#34;light&#34; or &#34;classicized.&#34; The feat is accomplished with no lack of power. Indeed, the driving rhythm of the introduction has rarely sounded so arresting, and the physical impact of the timpani and strings throughout is quite impressive. And while the tempi tend not to linger, Szell is never more than a minute and a half brisker than Herbert von Karajan's reading from his 77-78 cycle (this rather lush, supremely Karajan-esque set was my introduction to the symphonies, and while those performances are not perfect, they do seem to represent a middle path between the lighter Brahms of Toscanini and Szell, and the slower, thicker textures of, say, Celibidache). In fact, he is more than twenty seconds broader in the Andante Sostenuto.Finally, a word must be reserved for the remastering of this recording. I am not a serious audiophile or collector of historic recordings, but I have personally never heard a 1957 recording sound so clear and natural. This early stereo is demonstration-quality stuff, and it sounds worlds better than plenty of later stereo and digital recordings I could name. Never is anything remotely artificial, and Szell's interpretation is well served by an acoustic that allows the timpani to resound where they are often buried in a generalized orchestral slurry, and that bestows upon the strings a rosiny, just slightly gritty bite.In short, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. It is a bit pricey right now on Amazon, but I've seen it here and there in used record shops, being sold new for less than $10. It is, however, well worth full price and more. In my opinion, the only serious competition comes from F&uuml;rtw&auml;ngler, whose apocalyptic live 1952 performance might be the best thing that ever happened to the symphony. However, the sound is far inferior, and F&uuml;rtw&auml;ngler's traversal has the character of a one-off &#34;event,&#34; complete with extremely idiosyncratic tempi (the introduction is hammered out at probably less than half Szell's speed) and abrupt gear shifts that make little sense on paper but perfect sense in the moment. The difference should be obvious already: where F&uuml;rtw&auml;ngler's performance emanates directly from his overwhelming personality, while Szell's is far more objective. It is, quite simply, the apotheosis of objective, clear, and propulsive Brahms, and as such, makes for the natural reference recording. It pairs well with the F&uuml;rtw&auml;ngler, but does not suffer by comparison. Buy it.",l

"This is one of my favorite unknown bands, from Champaign, Illinois.  They have a captivating, ethereal, relaxing sound that really is unique.  The guitarist sounds inspired somewhat by The Edge from U2 (in The Edge's quieter moments like the song ""Bad"") and the lead female singer has a whispy, sweet, but rich sound similar to the lead singer of the Cowboy Junkies.  Very excellent, relaxing music.  The drummer was a punkish type who really adds a bit of energy and spice to the otherwise lulling sound of the rest of the band.  A very good blend of sound.The band never made anything better than this album, which is unfortunate because they are better than their Cowboy Junkie popular counterparts.",y
Fantastic CD,n

"What a wonderful concept and fantastic execution! Bennett still sounds great (Hey he's not 30-get over it), Krall is simply the preeminent jazz vocalist of this era, and the Bill Charlap Trio are simply divine as well. This record is a gift for fans of the Swing era, young and old. I've got a new appreciation for the Gershwins now and want to hear these songs again and again. Just like when I first heard Michael Buble, listening to this record makes not now only happy but also excited to learn more and seek out all the music of the Swing era and its modern interpreters.",k
"I’m shocked this took so long to be released. It’s just astounding. The sound quality is much better than I anticipated for a bootleg- well is it really that? As others have stated, the “sound check” songs suffer in quality but are worth it for the Mean Streets prequel- Voodoo Queen.Wish I had been at this show at the Pasadena Civic auditorium in October 77.  The energy is nothing short of tremendous.  This stunning set was recorded a couple of months before the band's superb debut album was released (in February 1978), the entire affair was recorded for live FM radio broadcast. According to many, this pivotal early gig remains quite probably the best concert the group put on during this time in their career.This disc is worth buying for Eddie’s performance in Eruption alone. He changed rock forever, has no equal. All four musicians are flawless. Dave’s screaming act is as hilarious as it is entertaining; he really is the best front-man ever. On this set he’s an evangelist of hard rock. VH fans who don’t own this, order it today!",G
"(Like tomorrow is the end of the world) - That exclamation pretty much sums up these discs and Steel Panther in general. This CD/DVD combo is some fantastic over-the-top entertainment, as only Steel Panther could pull off. The music is killer, and the “concert” with Bobbie Brown as bassist Lexxi’s mom is even better.All the songs are great done acoustically: “Fat Girl’” “Community Property,” and “Gloryhole” and the other SP classics. The CD’s lone new track “That’s When You Came In” stands out as one of this disc’s best songs and one of the band’s most melodic- a true double entendre hit single. There are differences between the CD and DVD’s tracks, and I prefer the later.All comedy bravado aside, these guys really excellent musicians who write memorable songs. Guitarist Satchel in particular impresses with his acoustic guitar in this short set.In allowing himself to be the butt of the joke throughout the concert/story, Lexxi must have the greatest sense of humor ever. Spoiler alert: His bedroom, looks nothing like you’d expect-but stop and think about it. Thanks SP for bringing back hair metal icon Bobbie Brown; her return to fame is long overdue.Come along for the “Weenie Ride!”",g
"Overall, I’m happy to at least have the album, but if you’re going to buy to get the whole set as a fan, don’t do it. Pre-order pack came in broken at the bottom, not giving too much reasoning for the seal at the top. Also, pre-order states there should be a poster and I did not receive one. It did come in early, but overall it wasn’t much of a surprise.",J

"Not bad for a casual listen but there appears to be too much in the way of orchestration and repetition and little in the way of variation and improvisation, which to me is the essence of Jazz. Of course, like abstract art, Jazz appeals to the senses in somewhat mysterious ways. There are two more Indigo CDs on the way but I doubt that there will be little difference in their style.",R

"This is an awesome little CD that will introduce anyone to many moments of the great works of Mozart.I bought this album originally in a cassette in about 1990, and then got the CD 10 or so years later. This one is a backup of my original CD, if it ever goes bad. Which speaks to its quality, since these are out of print.This CD is a refuge of sanity in the car, lovely at night when you are trying to quiet down and get ready for bed, or taking a long bath - also good background dinner music, even for those who think they don't like classical music.*One note - I almost gave it 4 stars, because these are excerpts of the Mozart movements, not the complete movements. I think when the London Symphony Orchestra did this project with Victoria Secret (when VS was CLASSY, not trashy), maybe they decided to make shorter, simpler versions for brand new classical music listeners, as an intro. I recognize that, now that I'm more familiar with the works. Little disappointment.  But these are lovely, nonetheless - and for me, the album that pulled me in so that now I adore Mozart.Another suggestion for a Mozart intro CD I love is the Classical Composers album with the little book. I love it.",]
"Found this one at a thrift store too. It is so fantastic, that i have bought more to share with family and friends! This has been my favorite CD for 3+ years. I adore Mozart,  It’s great driving music. The Marriage of Figaro overture  (first track) never fails to put me in a good mood, and help me catch up if I’m running late.  It’s a great gift for people just learning about Mozart,  and for those of us who have left him for years.",x

"Heard a piece from this on PBS and was captivated. I don't know how this soul became one with a violin to produce music for the heart broken but he has done it.  If you have ever had a lost dream, a broken spirit, a forgotten promise or the deepest sorrow that your heart could stand then you will love this as I do.  I have never heard the violin played to emote such pathos, deep regret and sadness as this.  Beautiful in its sorrow.",H

"I have quite a few of Tom Kenyon's CDs, and have, for the most part, come to expect an enjoyable, out of ordinary and out-of-the-box work and sounds from Tom...However I find this particular CD quite disappointing.  I was imagining some unusual, celestial, soothing sounds, but this just feels like he is practicing ""sounding"" (making sounds to express himself).The results are 8 tracks offering very little variations so they all sound pretty much the same - not very intriguing or interesting in the first place, repetitious, quite monotonous, somewhat annoyingly high pitched.I got bored listening to this CD in a hurry, and it will be a while before I go back to it again.Sorry Tom, maybe I just did not `get it'?",O

"Please read this review carefully!I have to confess, I didn't shell out $179.00 for this 2-CD set. Instead, I downloaded ""The Brussels Affair"" from Google Music for $4.99. That download contains 15 songs: Brown Sugar, Gimme Shelter, Happy, Tumblin' Dice, Star Star, Dancin' with Mr. D, Heartbreaker (Do Do Do Do Do), Angie, You Can't Always Get What You Want, Midnight Rambler, Honky Tonk Women, All Down the Line, Rip This Joint, JJ Flash and Street Fighting Man.This review is about that MP3 download.The download is a cleaned up, re-mixed and re-ordered (not sure why???) version of something originally broadcast years ago on the King Biscuit Flour Hour. It is (as near as I can tell) culled from several of the performances recorded on the $179.00 CD. But the 15 cuts I downloaded are of excellent, very high quality and mixed perfectly. Every note of Keith and Mick's guitars, Wyman's bass, Ian Stewart's (I assume) piano and Jagger's vocals come through crisp and clean. The performance is extraordinary. Better even that Get Your Ya Yas Out. Both Mick Taylor and Keith Richards are so ""on"" that it's scary. This is the best live playing by either of them separately or together that I have ever heard. Compared to this, the latter day Rolling Stones live recordings with Ron Wood'a wimpy""lead"" playing make me cringe. There is simply no comparison. Taylor's leads on almost everything are near-perfect, and Keith's ferocious rhythm guitar, most notably on Midnight Rambler, is nothing short of awe-inspiring. This was the ""real"" Rolling Stones. So what are you waiting for? Go find the $4.99 download and I bet you never listen to another live recording with Ron Wood playing ""lead"" again.Very Highly Recommended.JMT",y

"First off if you want to shake the house with Wanamaker peddle notes this is not the recording for you. What this is, is  historical performances by world class organists circa 1940.  This type of recording is important in your collection because you are listening to how a particular organist is playing, his style, meter, etc you are not really listening to the organ its self.  If you are an organist yourself these recording would be an important thing to use with a musical score to make notes as to how to play something in, as an example, the style of Virgil Fox who said he added 6 notes to what ever J.S.Bach  wrote.  If you love the music of these gigantic pipe organs, and especially are fans of those who played them in the first half of the last century you must have this CD in your collection.",S

All my favorite arias and duets are here, sung by well-known and talented artists.If you're new to opera, you can't go wrong with this album. Puccini was the Spielberg of his time, and his work still has a lot of popular appeal. (It's much easier to like ""La Boheme"" than Wagner's Ring cycle -- that's for sure!)If you have a lot of opera already, you probably have most of these songs.

Great interpretation of some pop standards like 'Summerwind' , 'Thanks for the Memories""  Even decent vocals by Monty Alexander, particularly on 'Hard Times'  But I did not like what happened at the mixing board.  Somebody did not like Ray Brown.  When there was a Bass solo, the volume dropped way down.  On the first track, 'Blues for Groundhog' that Brown was credited for composing, it opened with a long bass solo and I had to crank it way up to hear it at all.  Yet with others playing, the bass came through clearly.  Wish the liner notes had more information, but it was in German which I could not read.",O
"I bought this when it came out and ended up giving it to a friend who never returned it. If you're a die-hard Lucero friend, it's a fun watch. Filmed during the time leading up and including the recording of Bikeriders (which is my opinion their best album and a real turning point for the band). I've loved this band since I first saw them touring That Much Further West and I'm impressed and amazed at the growth and maturity of the band. They deserve all the success and recognition. This is a fun time time capsule of a young, drunk, ready-to-break Lucero.Watch it for free on YouTube in it's entirety - don't pay $200+ for it here - use that money to prop up artists that have had a tough year due to cancelling shows/tours.",i
"My brother passed away from a very aggressive brain tumor in November.  No warning, few symptoms.  Went into hospital on a Sat and died the following sat from a seizure. Luckily he was not in pain & really didn't realize how bad things were.  He wasn't his normal self, but he still joked around.  it was a blessing that he died like he did.  I have talked to too many people that know people that have died from Glioblastoma, it is awful and painful.  That being said, he was my big brother and the song on this cd was beyond perfect for the memorial service for him.  &#34;Jealous of the Angels&#34; is an amazingly beautiful song on this CD.  I listen to it all the time in my car.  I have come to love the entire CD.  After reading Donna Taggarts biography the songs meant even more to me.  Amazing woman!",Q
This CD is part of a series that have been my favorite for years. I am thankful to have it (and the others) on CD again!,v

"I discovered Anna Hutto at least 10-years ago. She came to our church in Lubbock for a concert. I'm not sure how that came to be, but was I amazed at her talent with words and loved to listen to her voice. At the time the only CD she had was Journey, which I bought at the concert.I tried to find other recording by her over the years, but without success. A few years ago I heard she was producing a new recording, but I missed it. Fortunately, I discovered the recording, Welcome Here, a couple of weeks ago. I managed to capture a used copy from the Amazon Marketplace. It arrived this afternoon. It's already ripped and stored in my iTunes library and on my iPod. I listened this afternoon and was amazed that her voice sound more mature... a little richer.Her talent with words is unabated as well. It will take me a few more listens to really get the work, but I already know this will be one of my favorite recordings, just like Journey before it.All I can say is that I wish there was more of her work. It's good work.",E
"Great song, arrived in great condition!",R
Very sweet album.,j
"Loved this album years and years ago, although his voice is not the nicest vocal. Haha. But the lyrics and the rhythm suited me just fine. Listening to it now brings back pleasant memories of lifetimes past. Too bad he squandered his career as an artist (I think). But very few people can really withstand so much sudden notoriety, I guess. Anyway, the package was nice, came way ahead of schedule, and I think this is a collectible now.There is another Edward Furlong album (one with poems and such). Anybody selling it?",T
"Excellent music, received as described.",Z
Fun book for kids. I like the positive slant book takes on things that could potentially be frightening for children.,y
"Horrible book.  If you are a Prince fan do you want pictures of an empty airport, empty hotel rooms, and spreads of his background dancers?  No.  There are way too many 'filler' pictures of people and things who are not Prince.  Extremely disappointed.",v
Wish I could have heard him play in person! This is a real treat.,o
The 90s ruled music and this is a reminder of that fact. It's a great album that should be in any lover of rock's collection.,Q
The CD arrived in excellent condition. The seller took great care to package the CD so it wouldn't get damaged. It was brand new and sounded great. Brings back old times listening to Bobby Womack.,E
Happy to finally find this. Sadly my phone won't play cassettes.,r
My grandson loves this CD.,x
Pentatonic is a fantastic singing group and I bought this for Christmas … perfect for the holiday season!,v
"Received 3 days early and was well packaged and is exactly as described by the seller. The record is as flat as my turntable platter and tracks and plays beautiful. It is hard to find an original 45 in such good shape. This is the original recording of &#34;YOU&#34; on Fargo Records 1958 and is done so beautifully by Lynne Nixon (original vocalist). After her passing, and in later years, it was recorded by Collette DeLaney with the original Aquatones as backup. Collette's rendition is also totally awesome as both artists sounded so close in vocals. The seller went the extra mile and put it in a nice sleeve with plastic liner covering the holes. I am very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend this seller, and would not hesitate to order again... Customer satisfaction is a strong point...............5TARS",k
Received 3 days early and was well packaged with no damage. Overall excellent record that plays beautiful with no faults. I am very satisfied with my purchase as well as the sellers description being accurate. Would not hesitate to order again. Went the extra mile to put jacket in vinyl sleeve for added protection. 5 STARS............,L
"I received this album 3 days early which was a nice surprise. The packaging was excellent, as the record was out of it's jacket in the inner sleeve and sandwiched between the jacket and an empty jacket. It was super cushioned to avoid any damage. The sellers concerns that you get a good product that is undamaged is MUCH appreciated. The record was as described by the seller and plays with no pops, ticks, hiss, and no skipping. The original inner sleeve has album advertising from Coral records depicting some early artists which has that nostalgic touch and the original jacket is in excellent condition which is a plus. I received a good product from the seller at a good price and I am totally satisfied. You cannot go wrong here and I plan to order again. Fast service, fast shipping, great product. 5 STARS.......",P
"Beautiful music!  The Living Strings was RCA's in house go to orchestra used on various music backgrounds. This spin off became RCA Camden and was considered an economy label for lesser known titles. This is a very International recording due to the fact that RCA's orchestra was from NY playing music from Hawaii and the album was recorded in England in 1970. Now all that being said, let's get to the music. This is the most beautiful Hawaiian album that I have ever heard. It is easy listening, relaxing and romantic. The stereo separation is fantastic and makes the Hawaiian steel guitars really showcase the album. Just put it on, sit back, close your eyes and enjoy a nice trip to the islands. Just key on the sellers and read the info that they provide and then you can decide. There are several who sell good used albums. My copy was pristine in all respects and can't tell it from a new one. Well worth every penny. 5 STARS",P
The vocals on this cd are the best. The audience clapping frequently during the performance is a distraction. However it was a recorded live performance. It was like being in Carnegie Hall.,U
There are so many contemporary Christian musicians who write music with two or three lines of lame lyrics and repeat them throughout the song and count that as talent. This album combines meaningful lyrics with great Irish music. All the lyrics are included as well so you can sing along when no one else is home :-) .,I

"This is an audio CD, NOT a DVD.  But, it can come in really handy.  I play this CD behind me on my boombox (you remember those!) while I do Leslie Sansone workouts.  It gives me such a boost and I don't experience the boredom I usually do with her music.  I'm 52 and many of these songs are from my college years or early adulthood, so I really enjoy them.",a

Careless child destroyed the original which was part of a set. This item makes the set whole again !!!! Yeah !!!,a
"NICE LITTLE BRIDGE ..It is not a roller bridge it is old school gibson style style, but pretty well made! The only inexpensive bridge that comes with bushing springs. Problem for me is my hagstrom uses a 52.4mm and this one is between 47 & 48mm and i think that would cause intonation problems,, so since this is a very good bridge i will hold on to it for use another day.. Sorry i could not comment on the sound, But the the workmanship is good well made piece of machinery.",E
This is a great CD and I have waited on it ever since they were on The Voice. They have an amazing harmony and I love their playing and singing together. Hope to hear a lot more from these two and hear them often on the radio as people hear and learn more about them. They are a really great brother duo!,B

"The haunting beauty of these songs really hits home. The artist does a great job of expressing how Inuit people are as mistreated in Canada as US Native Americans are. Mixing of the languages provides a neatly done effect. Even those who don’t speak her native language can understand the basics.The beauty of her songs and voice makes me hit replay over and over.There’s also a really wonderful mix of painful and joyous emotions in the songs that if you cannot grok to it, well...your loss I guess",t

"Great CD, for all true Allman Bros fans. Made me feel that I was back at the Fillmore East listening to Duane and the band playing live. Not a studio album or professionally recorded but a kid with an old fashioned tape recorder so don't expect, ""Eat a Peach"" etc. Important historical recording for your Allman Bros collection, especially if you never had a chance to hear the great Duane Allman sing/play live. Heartily recommend.",T

"The music from this movie is fabulous. However, the piece &#34;Mountain Dance'  also by Dave G., is not part of this CD. Mountain Dance is played right at the beginning of the movie and played again when she is 'changing clothes'. A bit disappointing; however, the music is lovely.",_
"Zbigniew Presiner is a favorite composer of mine. This is a Christmas album, but, for me, since it is in Polish, I do play is all year. Well, I play a lot of Christmas all year, but this is 1 I like. He is a very talented composer & his music is melodic & soothing on this cd.",p

It was I who helped him launch his career as an Abraham Lincoln Presenter. He gave me enough newspaper articles to fill a scrapbook. He also gave me all the music he recorded.

"Another beautiful collection of meditations from Rupert Spira! Listening to these &#34;yoga meditations&#34; really does help you lose the feeling of being a separate person located in a body. He uses interesting visualizations, like imagining the breath coming not just through your nose but through the entire surface of the body -- and you understand in a physical way that there's really no boundary between yourself and the space around you. I highly recommend this set to anyone who (like me) loves the teaching of nonduality but needs help with experiencing it as a reality.Unlike the other reviewer, I had no trouble loading the mp3s onto my phone, so the CDs obviously aren't copyright protected.",x
"A great work of music.  It won't suit the tastes of everyone, but it's a bit of history and you can feel it.  If you are a true music lover, you will want to own this CD set.  And while I don't get anything for saying this, you can find this album at amchitka-concert, and not pay $150.00. All proceeds to Greenpeace.",o

"Okay, the main reason I bought this 5-disc live set (Kansas has a bunch of live recordings) was for the 1982 recording with John Elefante on lead vocals.  There are no other recordings with him on vocals, and he has a fantastic voice.First the negative:  The 1977 and 1980 discs have poor (but not overly poor) recording quality.  ""Two for the Show"" is a much better recording of the ""Point of no Return"" tour.  The 1980 recording has many songs from ""Audio Visions"" that have not been heard live before.The 1976 recording is good, and it has much of the old stuff that you would want to hear live.  That leaves the 1982 ""Vinyl Confessions"" tour. (I got to see the ""Drastic Measures"" tour, and I still want to have a live recording of that one!).  The 1982 disc sounds the best of all.  ""Yes, but it's not Steve Walsh,"" you may say.  And I will tell you, when Elefante sings the Walsh songs, he sounds fantastic! I have heard about 7 live versions of Carry on Wayward Son, and they just don't sound good.  Elefante kills it on this one!  It sounds great!  He also does a great job with No One Together, Hold On, and Portrait (He Knew).Buy this collection for the 1982 recording.",W
"This is an extremely raw recording.  It's not bad, but it's not great either.  The background vocals are off key at times.  I've seen Journey 3 times--twice with Perry and once with Arnel.  Arnel sounds much better live.  There are some highlights here though:  Solid recordings of Rubicon, Edge of the Blade, and an okay version of No More Lies from Schon's solo album.  One last note.  This is the &#34;Frontiers&#34; tour.  Where is Separate Ways, the biggest hit from that album?",g

"This is a great group.  I really enjoy their music.  Twenty years ago I visited Halifax.  I heard this group singing.  I contacted their managed, trying to get a CD.  He did send me several from other groups but unfortunately, this group did not have one.  As the years past I still remembered how much I had enjoyed them.  A few months ago I thought I would google them.  I was surprised to find that they now had become more well known.  I ordered all I could by them and am enjoying all of their music very much.",w

The sound of the CD is excellent and I can’t tell you how happy I am to finally have a good copy of this album! Keep up the good work.",Q
Nice mix,y
"Excellent collection of Polish 80's pop by Urszula.  Considering the setting & time--a country behind the Iron Curtain, under a military dictatorship since '81, US sanctions imposed--this is top notch music.  Easily comparable to Kim Wilde or Pat Benetar with more synths thrown in.",u

"I remember buying this album when I was in my early 20s, back in the 70s. I was broke so the price alone was an incentive to buy it (I'm thinking around $2-3). Of course, there were a few musicians I was familiar with, as well. Much to my surprise I think I enjoyed every cut. I believe there was a second album put out that I purchased and it was also very good. I've always wished I could find both albums recorded as a CD.",W
So glad I found this.  I love the music from this movie and it's not what I could find on the soundtrack itself.,I
Very motivating terrific music.,I
Great music for workouts.  Used this when it first came out am planning on getting back into shape,l
Great instrumental classics (mostly country) from the master of stringed instruments. Roy also explains the difference between an instrumental and a vocal.,x
Get it. Just...get it! Those who say that Christianity and science don't go together may find this to be interesting.,i
"Symphony No. 2 is Johannes Brahms's most lyrical symphony, and it has received a host of superb recordings.  The present 1981 DG disc presents the account by Carlo Maria Giulini and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.Giulini immediately conveys that his will be an intense, emotional interpretation but not at the expenses of the lyrical element.  The 1st movement is typical of Giulini's approach.  Forte tutti's are forceful but the softer passages are sublime.  The 2nd movement is beautifully played and sweet as can be.  Yet, Giulini always supports the interpretation with an intense undercurrent of emotion.  The sublime is never far from the tension, and the final two minutes reveal the inner substance to be the juxtaposition of lyricism and strength.  The 3rd movement is a walk, simple and innocent, then a serious, intense dance, but one of joy.  The 4th movement begins softly with the glorious explosion of full orchestra confirming the intensity that joy can contain.  I have heard some beautiful accounts of this symphony, such as the surprisingly robust recording of Celibidache, but I can't think of one that tops this in any meaningful way.  The final minute of the movement is the greatest I have ever heard.  It is truly astonishing!When you listen to Giulini's masterful account of this wonderful symphony, you get the feeling that this must be what the master intended.  It feel that right.  I would not complain if this was the only account I could ever listen to again.  The sound is fully supportive of the majesty of the reading.  Despite the 1981 recording date, this early digital recording bears few if any of the faults so common in recordings from that period.  The brass may be the slightest bit grainy, but there is no early digital over-brightness.  Soundstage and center fill are superb.  This one is capable of evoking tears and that's what makes it magical.  It easily gets my ABSOLUTE HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!!!",l
"Eugene List was a pupil of Olga Samaroff at Juilliard who also taught Roslyn Tureck.  He had an illustrious concert career but his recordings are hard to find, now.  This Vanguard disc presents him in performances of the piano music of Louis Moreau Gottschalk.  The first disc is devoted to two-hand piano music, while the second features one-piano four-hands and two-piano works.Disc 1 begins with one of Gottschalk’s most well-known works, The Banjo.  While I have heard faster accounts, I have heard none with such rounded tone. Nor has the piano been recorded so well.  If you have never heard The Banjo, you are in for a real treat.  This is the finest performance of the virtuoso piece ever!  I will mention a few other pieces of note beginning with Souvenir de Porto Rico which receives a caring performance and perfect idiomatic playing.  This is a rather sultry piece, and List gives it plenty of sway.  You won’t fail to be impressed.  Bamboula is another of popular pieces.  It is the forerunner to the cakewalk.  The reading is luscious.  The Last Hope is a mournful piece of great beauty.  Tournament is a gallop that is just plain fun to hear.Disc 2 is comprised mostly of arrangements by List and Cary Lewis.  They are, of course, performed with distinction, but I have little interest in arrangements as they are not the intent of the composer.  Only Tremolo is the original Gottschalk version and it receives a superb performance by List and assistant.  This is a very lively work with a wonderful theme.  The four hands almost play as one.This is a superb album of Gottschalk piano music.  The second disc is equally enjoyable but largely consisting of arrangements.  The piano sound is excellent but sounded like a different instrument on Disc 2.  Curious.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Disc 1!!!",e
"From the high quality of the sonics, it is difficult to believe that Sir George Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, and London Symphony and Philharmonic Orchestras recorded these 19 Famous Overtures for Decca between 1959 and 1994.  These are classic works most of which are known to serious and casual classical music lovers alike.  What is even more surprising, however, is that the two from 1959, Suppe's Light Calvary and Pique Dame Overtures are two of the best sounding of the group.  Both were performed by the VPO.Every overture on these two discs receives a committed, convincing, and exciting performance.  I found none whose tempo was excessively fast or slow.  The inconsistency of sound was in keeping with the range of recording dates, but earlier recording dates did not predict the quality of sound.  This 2-disc album affords the listener a generous sampling of well-known overtures interpreted by a world-class conductor leading world-class orchestras with generally excellent sound.  If the sound had been more consistent, I would have awarded 5-Stars.  As it stands, the album is a safe recommendation!",b
"Frederic Chopin modeled his 24 Preludes after Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier.  Before a concert, Chopin would seclude himself with a piano and play through the WTC for memory.  Like Bach, Chopin wrote a Prelude in each major and minor key.  Each one is a masterpiece with each its own prevailing mood.  In the present album, Ivan Moravec performs the set of Preludes and the Ballade No. 4 on the Supraphon label, recorded in 1963.In Moravec's hands, the Preludes take on new lives.  He plays them with a fresh approach.  When you listen to them, you can hear him feeling his way through each of them.  Take No. 6 in B minor, for example.  If No. 15 is the ""Raindrop Prelude,"" then No. 6 should be the Teardrop Prelude.  Its sublime melancholic melody is unparalleled in the piano literature.  In contrast, No. 7 in A major is a sweet but brief smile played.  No. 9 in E major is performed with serious majesty, but I wish it was less disjointed and more flowing.  Moravec demonstrates his superb technique and light touch with No. 10.  Unlike the interruptions of No. 9, the Prelude in G-sharp minor which can sound disjointed is flowing.  Odd.  No. 15 in D-flat major receives the finest performance I have heard.  The emotion flows throughout but it never becomes thick and overly dramatic.  I have always loved this Prelude, and Moravec more than any pianist conveys perfectly its exquisite and anguished feeling state.  No. 20 in C minor was played at Chopin's funeral.  It can sound ponderous in some hands but not in Moravec's.  The F minor Ballade concludes the disc.  It is given a heavenly performance by Moravec who conveys perfectly the intense moods of the work.This is the finest set of Preludes I have been privileged to hear.  The treble of Moravec's piano can sound hard in loud passages but not so much that it diminishes the pure joy of his magnificent interpretations and overall performance.  For me, this represents the definitive ""modern"" recording of the Preludes.  I give it my ABSOLUTE HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!!ADDENDUM:  The 2009 reissue of this recording has tamed the aforementioned treble hardness.  The reissue is now the top account of these Preludes.  I reviewed it at http://www.amazon.com/Chopin-24-Preludes-Ballade-No4/dp/B000003521/ref=cm_cr-mr-title",[
"When it comes to recordings of the complete Brahms symphonies, we really have an embarrassment of riches - superb accounts by Karajan, Klemperer, Dohnanyi, and Levine, to name those whom I consider the top-shelf Brahms conductors in the last 50 years.  You can't go wrong if you chose a cycle by any of them.  The question here is if Lorin Maazel should be added to those esteemed few?  Maybe.  Maazel conducts the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra in 1975 and 1976 recordings of the four symphonies plus the Academic Festival and Tragic Overtures, and the Haydn Variations.Maazel has never been considered a member of the elite circle of conductors, but he also seems never to turn in less than average performances, either.  His Brahms cycle here begins with a superb reading of Symphony 1 that plays to both the profound and lyrical elements equally well.  If it lacks the absolute nth degree of excitement, the emotional warmth of his account, as demonstrated in the dolce and animato theme in the 4th movement, may completely atone for the slight sin of omission.  The Academic Festival Overture and Haydn Variations demonstrate a superb performance less hampered by slight sonic deficiencies.The Symphony 2 greatly benefits by Mazeel's great ability to convey the lyricism of a work.  Symphony 2 has often been compared to Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony a linkage that Brahms would have been very touched by, since it was Beethoven's preeminence that intimidated Brahms and prevented him from bringing his first symphony out.  The 3rd movement is sculpted superbly from the contrasting slow and agitated sections.  The 4th movement with its long, winding primary and secondary themes and extensive development demonstrates Maazel's long view that maintains interest as Maazel carefully brings the movement to its smiling close.The Third Symphony is given a finely etched performance.  In the 1st movement, Maazel once again Maazel seems to take the contrasts in such easy stride.  The 2nd movement is shaped perfectly, and the 3rd movement's melancholic theme is treated with sublime tenderness.  The final movement seems to lack that previously nth degree of excitement again.  Brahms' Symphony No. 4 calls for passion, and Maazel responds passionately and intensely.  The 2nd movement's opening horn sets the stage for successive increases in the number of horns participating in a musical meditation performed beautifully by the Cleveland brass.  For me, the 4th movement has always seemed Brahms's least successful symphonic movement.  And Maazel is unable to change that.  The Tragic Overture that follows would have made a better 4th movement.The discs have superb sound for an analogue recording, but I wish the woodwinds would have been given a bit more brilliance by the engineers.  As a whole, Maazel's Brahms symphony cycle is a winner but just not an award winner.  Only a few issues keep him off the top rung of the ladder, but he is only a step away.  Recommended with a few reservations regarding excitement/intensity and dynamics.",e
"There are in essence two types of wind music.  The first type is comprised of Baroque brass music and transcriptions, especially by Gabrieli, and the purpose is for worship.  The second type is comprised of military marches the purpose of which includes celebratory but principally for the purpose of keeping cadence for marching troops.  This 2-disc album is of the second type and features Herbert von Karajan leading the Brass of the Berlin Philharmonic (plus some other wind instruments).  Now, for the purpose of this review, please join me in suspending any political overtones there might be in some of these pieces and their possible use in the past by the German Army of WW II.  I am speaking only to the music itself.If you love band, wind ensemble, or brass music, then you will love this album.  Each march is superbly played.  I am a veteran myself, and I frequently became aware of an irresistible urge to get up and start marching!  A few were composed by Beethoven, Johann Strauss and Johann Strauss the Elder.  One of my favorites is the Florentine March by Julius Fucik.  I first heard it on a Frederick Fennell disc.  The march that concludes the album is the well-known Radetzky March.The marches were recorded in 1966 and 1973, but the sonics are pristine.  The recording venue for all was Berlin's Jesus-Christus-Kirche, so the recording has wonderful ambience.  There are no real criticisms that can be levied against the music with the minor exception that Karajan was obviously never a marching soldier, because he strays occasionally from the strict tempo that military marches have at their very foundation.  He is actually trying to make music!  The nerve!These marches are performed superbly and the sound is stellar.  It is absolutely enjoyable from beginning to end.  This one gets my highest recommendation.  Forward March!",E
"Discs like these really irritate me.  These are wonderful accounts of the three tone poems on this disc which is a poorly-performed digital remaster of an earlier Supraphon disc.  The Supraphon disc also included an excellent account of The Noonday Witch.The digital remastering has the tympani so poorly defined that you hear only a rumble.  Also, it sounds as though the engineer decided to add some reverberation - TOO much.So what you get for your money is an over-reverberant edition of THREE tone poems ONLY.  For better accounts, try Chalabala's original version.  Even better, get  the superb Kertesz account on Decca Eloquence that in addition includes the Carnival Overture, Scherzo capriccioso, Symphonic Variations, Hussite Overture, My Home Overture, Othello Overture, and In Nature's Realm Overture.",h
"This is an SACD compilation of 12 short works for organ, brass and timpani and arrangements of works for such ensembles.  It is unique in two ways.  First, the selections are not just blockbusters but also serious music.  Second, you might assume that an SACD of Organ, Brass, and Timpani would be an astonishing disc.  It is not.The Strauss work with which the album begins is not widely known but is nonetheless a work of art.  Some of the selections are well-known but primarily among classical music lovers such as the Baroque period Overture from Handel's Royal Fireworks Music.  Gabrieli, another Baroque composer, is well represented by several of his sensational Canzons.  Bach selections include music from three of his Cantatas.  Even an arrangement of Mussorgsky's The Great Gate of Kiev from his Pictures at an Exhibition is included to bring the final curtain down on the disc and the two people who bought it.  In fact, I may be the only one!This disc suffers from selections that are not the most popular and sound that is good at best.  I have heard few organs more poorly recorded.  The organ is as unexciting as is most of the disc.  If you are looking for spectacular sonics or selections fairly well-known outside serious classical music circles, look elsewhere.  Two stars may be generous - and I'm a classical music lover.",H
"4 1/2 Stars.  This is a Japanese edition and most of what's written is in Japanese and German.  It is rather interesting that Igor Markevitch should conduct Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition as it concludes with the Great Gate of Kiev, the city in which he was born.  Kiev is only the conclusion of a unique and thrilling account of Pictures - thrilling at least until the end.Markevitch is definitely his own man.  To begin with, he is not afraid to take a retard in the concluding measures of an individual picture more than you usually hear with other conductors - and it makes you ask, ""Why don't all conductors do it?""  I found myself asking that question quite often.  Markevitch's sense of contrasts and dynamics is extraordinary.  It is as though you are hearing the work for the first time.  This is a truly fresh and remarkably successful approach to an old warhorse.The Great Gate of Kiev, actually, was the least impressive of the pictures (I don't think Markevitch lived there long!). Frankly, I think that Ravel should have beefed up The Great Gate of Kiev more.  (I want TWO orchestras AND a concert band to bring the piece to a close!  Too much???) Seriously, I expected more from the final tutti section than is heard.  The recording was made in 1973, and we have had many great recordings from the 1970's.  I just don't have an explanation.  The Great Gate of Kiev begins well, and you expect even better at the conclusion.  Interpretively, Markevitch keeps a strict tempo just before the conclusion when you desperately want a retard.  Downer.  But at least the tempo isn't as schizophrenic as in Serebrier's Naxos disc of Stokowski's orchestration.  Fantastic Great Gate of Kiev's are heard in Neeme Jarvi/CSO, Kuchar/Ukraine, Reiner/CSO, and my pick for the absolute best Picture - Ormandy/Philadelphia (the Japanese-produced disc).Sonics are stunning on this 24-bit processed disc.  Each instrument is clearly heard and very natural-sounding whether it is a trumpet, violin, bassoon, flute, or bass.  Yet you hear the ensemble.  As mentioned above, only the Great Gate of Kiev proved to be less than I expected.So what you have here is a superb sonics with the most original interpretation of Pictures that I have ever heard. And does it ever work!  Highly recommended (but get somebody else for The Great Gate of Kiev).",U
"This is not the cover art of the album I purchased, but the disc does appear to have originated in Japan as the majority of the print is in Japanese.  I have purchased some splendid Japanese remasterings.  This one isn't improved enough to justify the bother.The original EMI recording was remastered in 1992 as part of a several-volume set.  I think that Japanese engineers successfully cleaned up the treble but were able to do less for the bass.  The result is a distorted balance that favors the upper 2/3 of the frequency range with deep bass definition better defined but lacking in weight.  The tympani are recessed but better defined than in the 1992 reissued set. The organ is well heard but poorly defined. The upper registers are really quite good.But let's face it:  what makes this a classic is Kempe, who had amazing interpretive powers in Strauss.  This is one I really wish I could have heard in person.  Kempe took a perfect tempo for the work - not so slow that you feel lost and not so quick that you have little time to savor the scenery.  Kempe's account with the Staatskapelle Dresden is very moving with a clear vision of what lies ahead.  As such, the performance is highly recommended, but I would keep thing simple and stay with the domestic EMI release that I reviewed separately.  Come on, EMI.  Let's give this a state of the art remastering that it deserves!",w
"Ormandy and the Philadephia Orchestra made two recordings of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, one for Columbia (now, Sony) and a later one for RCA.  I recently reviewed the RCA disc on Amazon.  This is the earlier, prized account and it is easy to see why.  It is phenomenal!  Unfortunately, Sony released it on CD only in Japan.  The good news is that you can still pick it up from sellers in Japan.  Oh, and don't expect to read much of the trifold ""booklet"" that it comes with -- it's in Japanese except for the front.It is hard to believe that the pictures by artist, Hartmann, that served as the inspiration for this classic composition were simple little sketches!  Ravel's orchestration of the original piano pieces remains magnificent, and this is the recording that gives you all of the excitement and color you could wish for.  Ormandy gives us a well thought-out interpretation with great sound.  Pacing is perfect for each picture.  Dynamics are remarkable.  Bass is prolific and well-defined.  Instrument timbres are natural-sounding.  Brass couldn't be more thrilling. Belying its age, background noise is nonexistent.  Ormandy chose tempi that never dragged the music which flows like a meandering stream, sometimes a river.  The soundstage is full but not very deep.  Middle fill is fine.  The perspective is rather forward. The trumpets blare with a raspy quality that is, frankly, is over the top and to the point of being uncomfortable to listen to at times.  This is a problem that I have encountered before on Japanese discs.  I can't help but wonder if there was some remastering to highlight the upper end.  I have experienced this problems with Japanese remasterings, as well.  Otherwise, the disc is fantastic and confirms why this performance is so highly touted.I have compared this disc to the French and Great Performances discs.  I do think that the top end on the Japanese disc may have undergone additional remastering.  I discuss this further in my review of the French disc, if you would like further comments on the issue.This is just an exceptional performance, and aside from the high recorded level of the trumpets, is the leader in the field in most every way.  There are some that may approach it in some way or another, but none can top it!",H
"The 5th Symphony by Beethoven may be the most well-known of all symphonies ever composed.  The first four notes have been envisioned as fate knocking at the door, the symbol for victory (dit-dit-dit dah is the Morse code for the letter ""V""), or as Leonard Bernstein once said ""three quarter notes and a half.""  Whichever your interpretation, it is the most famous motif in the history of music.The current performance is powerful, majestic, and for some, plodding.  Hey, it's Klemperer.  While the tempo is slower than most in each movement and the 1960 recording is a bit harsh during loud passages, the interpretation is played with great conviction.  But there are few who can match the absolute power and majesty of the 4th Movement.  While I imagine that LVB would raise an eyebrow to the tempi, he would have been less likely to have found fault with Klemperer's handling of the final movement.  It is simply glorious even at the slightly slower tempo chosen by the conductor.  The final few measures are up to speed, celebratory, and place an exclamation mark on the effort.The Symphony No. 8 fares better with tempi but don't expect a light-footed reading.  Hello.  It's Klemperer.  The Eighth was written while Beethoven was composing its numeric predecessor.  It represents the pause that refreshes.  No so here.  The symphony receives a fine reading nonetheless, and it is less gargantuan in concept than Klemperer's Fifth.Klemperer's 5th is certainly stands in contrast to the white-hot reading of Carlos Klieber who commands 1st place in almost every reviewer's list.  But is there room for another recording at the top?  For as important a symphony as Beethoven's 5th, the answer must be yes.  But Klemperer, as unique as his account is, won't be there for me.  I would look elsewhere for a companion to Kleiber, maybe Szell.",T
"This is a very well-recorded Mahler First that is conducted by a man with three Mahler cycles under his belt.  It is clear that Lorin Maazel has a special relationship with Mahler, as who else has conducted three complete cycles.  So we should expect an exciting First.  Right?  Well, there are moments where that is true.  With all of the Mahler Firsts out there, however, moments are not enough, for almost every recording has those moments.  The bar must be higher or else we would include the majority of recordings.  For a recording of this symphony to pass muster, most of each movement should be worth listening to in repeat hearings.  Unfortunately, this recording is not one of the chosen few.The 4th Movement is the most successful of this recording and perhaps one of the finest of all recordings of the First Symphony.  The other movements, however, are less successful and are marred by tempi that drag or many moments that drag.  The orchestra is of course great and they have as much experience with Mahler as any around.  So, don't think that the sound has any problems.  It doesn't.  The interpretation, however, does not vie for top honors.  As great as the 4th Movement is, even it drags at times.In honor of the moments of joyful listening -- especially in the 4th Movement, I can only say &#34;Thanks for the memories&#34; as I file this one back in the drawer.  There are other recordings that are contenders on all counts.",Z

Check out Amazon's separate listing.  Now for why you might want to make this your own.&#34;Cover&#34; is the term for an artist performing a song either originally performed by or made a hit by another artist. This CD is all &#34;covers&#34; including Dion re-doing his own song, &#34;The Wanderer.&#34; The liner notes explain why Dion has such veneration for the artists and these songs.  There is a big element of respect in this....as there was when other artists such as The Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, and The Beatles did &#34;covers&#34; as well.  Some people actually prefer their versions of Walkin' the Dog, Hound Dog, and Twist and Shout....some actually think that these &#34;covers&#34; are the originals....but I digress.This is what comes through on each song:  Dion respects the material; he doesn't go to great lengths to fake the vocal of the original artist; he absolutely respects the instrumentation; the sound quality and production values are superb; the notes are helpful; and, you may find yourself liking some of these better than the originals.Dion has been engaged as a creative artist for decades --- he isn't getting along by doing the &#34;oldies circuit.&#34;  He is a wide-ranging vocal talent and he has made this album both with love and with some of the best studio musicians available.  If you like the Telecaster sound, you will really appreciate what he has put into each cut.  Both the songs selected and the performances have now stood the test of time. I listen to this CD frequently and often find a phrase or a riff that strikes (all over again) as super pleasing.  I hope you do, too.",L
"Great disc - Reflection Club sounds like lost recordings by Jethro Tull from the 70's.  This is a superb production that has all the style and nuances of classic Jethro Tull. As noted the high resolution files on the DVD are PAL encoded and will NOT play in most U.S. players so buyer beware! Highly recommended for fans of Jethro Tull and if you can play the DVD, high resolution and surround sound enthusiasts.Message from seller Madvedge:Dear Customer,Unfortunately we have only now noticed that there are problems in America with the playback of our DVD from the Mediabook ""REFLECTION CLUB - Still Thick as a Brick"". This is due to the fact that the DVD uses the PAL method for color reproduction. American players often only use the NTSC method and cannot play PAL DVDs. We were not aware of this problem, since European players can usually play both methods without any problems nowadays. Therefore we assumed that this is also the case in the USA. Now we have been proven wrong.Therefore, we will have the DVD converted to NTSC. When this process is complete, we will send you a download link through this channel, where you can download the NTSC image of the DVD. You should be able to play this image with a software media player, such as the free VLC player, or burn it directly to a blank DVD.We hope this won't cause you too much trouble.",n

"I really liked the movie in general but some of dialogue was unnatural or too formal. So as my title says, I try to accept it, even though I believe it needs improvement.  A possible reason for Anakin and Padme having too much formal dialogue (as I would put it) is that they both grew up very fast.We see Anakin in Ep.1 beyond his years as a boy and taken away from his mom to start his Jedi training because he's the *Chosen One*.  Big load on anyone's shoulders.  Padme was queen and now senator.  Can you say, no personal life?  I say this because I like giving people the benefit of the doubt and I understand that movies should be watched with an open mind instead of often exagerated expectations.Someone else critized Natalie Portman's acting when she didn't react strongly to Anakin's slaughter of the sandpeople because it was horrible and over-exaggerated justice, which took him one big step towards the dark side. It would be believeable to say that Padme would think, in light of his mom's death and Anakin's anguish, they all deserved to die because they're a menace and a threat to peaceful people. On top of that, it wouldn't be appropriate to start scolding Anakin at that moment for killing all of them. She is a skilled negotiator and knows when to hold her tongue and when to speak.I get frustrated when people become harsh critics of decent movies because most of the time they fail to understand characters' motives, the movement of the plot, etc..  In this case, Ep.2, we have dialogue that was stiff at times and given to young actors who did the best they could with it.  I'm sure Sir Alec Guiness would've done a better job with the same lines but he's got decades of life and job experience over Hayden. Cut the kid some slack and try to enjoy the movies people. Just assume that Anakin spends too much time with fixing machines to know how be smooth with the ladies. HAHA!Lastly, yeah Jar Jar was annoying but that doesn't mean he shouldn't exist! The Star Wars movies aren't a perfect universe where no annoying people ever exist.  People should realize that you need to watch a movie not as a person in a theatre but as if you were a bystander in the story. Immersing yourself in the movie and not being critical allows you to enjoy the movie a lot more. Accept Jar Jar for what he is, an annoying character, but don't go wishing how the movie *should've* been. If everyone would do that you'd have a million different Star Wars movies.  Accept them for what George wanted to portray and stop whining.  :)",q

It's a great selection of songs, but far more importantly, these sisters have some of the greatest voices I have ever heard. All this, and the greatest 3 part harmony my ears have ever feasted upon. Did I mention the amazing recording quality? Buy this and you'll be a happy music lover. ...........(2015) 10 years later, I still second the motion. The recording quality is reason enough to buy this - if it's still available. Many of the songs are without peer.",G

In the early 70’s my sisters and I loved it when Tubular Bells was played on the radio. It was different from the other music played. We all distinctly remember deep bong like bells as part of the piece…it was magnificent. I have some  expensive wind chimes that have that same sound although not exactly the right notes. Believe me three hundred dollar wind chimes are not something my budget usually allows but the sound we all loved was so similar that I indulged. When I found I could buy the CD from Amazon my sisters and I were all thrilled. We are all close to 70 years old and after fifty years we were so excited to hear one of our favorite tunes again. OMG…..the disappointment. I am sorry I spent the money. We agree Mike Olfield is a very talented man. If you grew up in a different generation then you will probably be satisfied. We were not!,B
"I'm a geezer, so my grandchildren tell me, but I like Alan Parson's Project.  I also like The Wall and other music from 30+ years ago, but they released this album on Blu-ray and they did a great job.  I have a 7.2.4 surround system and you wouldn't believe how great this album sounds.  WOW!!",i

"I have been a fan of Cynthia Clawson since the 80's.  Back then, her cassette tapes(!) were easy to find and she was easy to find performing in various venues around Texas; where I was in college.  I think this is the best recording she's made.  The music is beautifully arranged, and the choice of hymns is great.",Y
"He is very entertaining and systematic. I lowered to 3 stars because of his essentialistic Eurocentric argument that Western music has essentially universal appeal simply because of its qualities and not at all because of political and military domination.

LOVE THIS RECORD. Such a cute story.,X
"We homeschooled our children and these cd's were one of the ways we incorporated scripture memory into our day.We now have grandchildren who are beginning their homeschool journey, so I bought this for my daughter and the moment she opened the box, she shouted, &#34;I remember these, I wanted to get them for the kids!&#34; She then proceeded to sing some of the songs/scriptures she had memorized 20+ years ago.Songs are a great way to memorize scripture and Steve Green's Hide 'Em in Your Heart is perfect for the job!",[

great product.great music.,s

"This album is very musically dynamic. I enjoyed the changes in &#34;tone&#34; as I moved from each track. There are also quite a few mid tempo ballads on this one, different from what I've heard on their other albums. Duet is my favorite mid tempo track. Some other favorites off of this album are Maximum, I Don't Know, and シアワセ色の花 (one of my all time favorite Toho songs).I really like the photos included in the album booklet too. Inside, I found a small yellow piece of film. I'm assuming the other versions include one as well. Just wondering what I'm supposed to do with it.This was definitely a worthwhile purchase. I recommend this album 100% to jpop lovers/Tohoshinki fans. We are T!-Chi",s
LOVE....Thank you Evanescence!,X
"ok, for those of you that are not familiar with 5nizza (the Russian word for ""Friday"") they are a Russian Reggae group. The sing in Russian with Jamaican accents. Basically its 2 guys, one of which play great jazzy/classical guitar, and they both sing. At the end of the cd is a cover of Bob Marleys ""Jammin"" which is spot on.... If you like laid back raggae/rap/aweseom jazz-classical music and you dont mind that you might not know what theyre singing about, then 5Nizza is for you. Its a great album to play in teh background at a party, or when your just hangin out with friends. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this album except that it makes me wish i could speak Russian....",I

"The Trinity Carol Roll (in the Trinity College Library at Cambridge) is a parchment scroll over six feet long and is the earliest source for English polyphonic carols. It is rare document, providing both text and music dating from the early 15th century.  It includes a carol written in celebration of Henry V's victory at the Battle of Agincourt - written shortly after that famous battle.This recording brings that music to life.  It is a beautiful performance by Alamire, one of the leading vocal consorts in the UK.  I highly recommend this for the quality, the musicianship, and the amazing music.  If you love history or choral music or the medieval era, you will love this recording.  If you are looking for something just a little bit different to add to a collection of Christmas music, this is a great choice for that, too.",I
"Would someone post the song list please?I took one star off because I feel the sound man went way thin with effects... pretty raw. Also, by the way, you can hear a most incredible version of Johnny live (even though it's an amateur recording with a cheap cell phone) by entering ""Johnny Rivers Live In Beverly Hills - Poor Side Of Town"". at youtube.  I wish he would cut that live version for us.",L
"This may be the Grass Roots ultimate performance, because after so many years of performing their songs they are bound the just keep improving, but then on this occasion they have the most awesome back up band ever.  The brass section on this recording is tighter than any I have ever heard... EVER!!  And you don't get a lot of wasted filler with audience applause either, as is the nuisance with most live albums IMO,  the songs just start right off and end neatly.  It's just too bad this CD is in such short supply.  But if you can get a copy I do believe that you will have possession of the best of their best.",J
I can listen to this over and over its wonderful,u

"I've tried a half dozen or more different record cleaning solutions over the years and this stuff is the best. Since I discovered L'art Du Son, it's all I use, with some minor caveats. As others have mentioned, for vinyl with heavy soiling or buildup, first cleaning with an enzymatic cleaning solution is very helpful. I like Audio Intelligent's solutions but there are others that I've heard work just as well. The L'art Du Son solution not only gets into the grooves, lifting out grime and debris very effectively, it also leaves the vinyl surface virtually static free. Another added bonus is that if gives off a pleasant mild floral aroma while you're cleaning with it.",j

"For those of you who may not know, Black Tulip is actually a label put out by Little Walter Devenne..the famous radio personality who currently resides in New Hampshire. Although he no longer does live broadcasts, his show are still syndicated, if you can find them in your particular neck of the woods.He is also in the production business & has produced a number of pieces, including several  box sets. This particular piece, as has been noted, is bootlegged, and the artwork leaves something to be desired; however, the sound quality is good..and what I like about it is that is has the original MONO version of 1962's &#34;Fat Boy&#34;, which has been released on several packages, but in what I call &#34;fake&#34; stereo.",w
love it ...how can you not?,[
"My niece loved it.  She wanted the CD, not the photo album.",r
The sound is good and clear and the 1st 3 songs are some of their best songs ever however it does sound very similar to the studio album versions of the songs even though it's live so keep that in mind but it is a great buy,s

"This is a nicely put together CD with recordings spanning 1943 to 1949. A discography is included. Kudos to Sabam Crescendo for keeping this music alive.I saw Benny Carter in concert around 1980 and it's amazing that even then he had 6 decades of jazz behind him. Truly an under appreciated giant talent.As well as his prowess on the saxophone, Benny Carter was a master arranger and all the tracks on this CD are rich with polyphony.Having said that, the arrangements are all ""hot"", with trumpets ablare, and generally up tempo. And Benny Carter takes too many solos. Give me Johnny Hodges any day, and the variation and subtlety of Count Basie's band from the same era.The best of both worlds would be Carter's arrangements for the Basie band, that is big band music without peer.",z
"Well, for Justin Timberlake I would say this CD is probably someone else's music that he is singing.  There are a few songs that make you recognize the sound but the majority of the CD has a &#34;older,&#34; &#34;Jazzy&#34; type quality to the music.  I like the songs but it's seems like the majority of the songs were designed for behind closed doors intimacy between two people, not really dancing.  #10 (Blue ocean floor) is just a &#34;what??&#34; song.  Totally doesn't follow the flow of the CD. I think he could have done better, but I love JT so I can't talk bad.",T
It works,g
"My children, ages 6, 8 & 9 LOVED listening to this. The dramatic presentation is excellent, and the story is one that speaks to character development. It is engaging and keeps their attention well. As soon as they reached the end of the story, they begged to listen to it all again!",]
"I had a John Denver CD that was him, but not all of the songs were actually ""original"" versions.  It was recorded for a TV movie about his life.  I am a perfectionist about songs, and I recognized a couple of notes that were different, noting that they had obviously (to me) been re-recorded.  This 3 CD set includes all 3 of his Greatest Hits CD's, and these beautiful and joyous songs ARE the original recordings.  I am always surprised that so many people ignore John Denver, considering him as a lightweight.  He was an early supporter of environmental causes, and spoke from the heart.  I saw him twice in concert, and he was a delightful entertainer.  And, if you listen to the words in his songs, he definitely spoke of non-middle of the road subjects.  This set includes humor, love and songs about nature.  I love it, and so will you.",Q

"Great CD. Beautiful, insightful lyrics on a wide range of topics. High quality musical production with a backing band and backing vocals. Buddy is in the singer-songwriter genre. I've only seen him once in concert but it was an excellent concert, so I recommend going to see him. Great voice, high quality guitar playing and good stage presence.",s
"Amazing lyrics and her voice is one of the best I've heard anywhere. I think she must be an undiscovered talent because I fully expected to see a lot of reviews on here when I came to buy it/ I borrowed this CD from a family member and loved it so much I'm going to get it and the two other albums of hers (I don't know if they're as great as this, but I'm willing to risk it given the high return I got on this first one). It really is A level music. It's Irish flavored with appeal to a huge variety of people. If Amazon or some other site you find will let you download one song at a time, try ""The Dear Irish Boy"" - gourgeous lyrics and arrangements. Timeless. Most albums you buy have maybe 1 great song, 1 good song and trash after that. This I'd say has 3 great ones, 5-6 good ones, a couple so-so ones and I couple I didn't like. That put it in the top 1-2% of albums I hear and I'm a very picky listener and have listened to loads of music. Her voice and her timing/ability are excellent. Some have a great voice but don't know how to use it. Julee is a rare one with both. Hopefully she gets discovered enough so she can keep putting out great music.",`

"I picked up a used copy of ATM's ""Unusual Moments"" this week after seven years of trying to find it.  Never bought it at the local record store when they were popular locally.  Band got good airtime on WCPR (same station that 3 Doors Down broke out on, but slightly later) in Biloxi in 2001.  Oddly, the band had to change their name to ATM because of 3 Doors Down.  ATM's old name... 2 Doors Down.  Maybe and Hold On were the hits at the time.  Matchbox 20ish, perhaps Train-like in some respects, with a little Collective Soul rolled in.For me the CD is a five star album, but only because I've been trying to find it forever.  For everyone else, it isn't bad nor great, thus a three star rating.Good luck finding this one.Vocals:  Jonalan LulayLead Guitar: Bill ""Slide"" ShanleyDrums:  Dennis ChippsBass: Ryan StattonRhythm Guitar:  Matt LaymanUPC-A code: 7 91022 20092 8",n
"Al Pitrelli and Tony Harnell should be magic and often, it is, but the problem with doing a disc of covers, especially well-known ones, is that it can very rapidly get boring and some of them, like the Queen track, are both not in need of a remake and done poorly here. I'm sure this was huge in the Japan market for which it was intended, but consider this more for completists only.",d
"Both heart warming and tears flowing watching this great talent knowing make his last stand - all of the members shared equally in the revenue, once again reminding us that if you were his friend, you were his friend. The sparkle was there in his eyes and voice, but unfortunately not in his fingers. Although missing his marvelous lead guitar fingers, his heart warms all the music.If you are are a Waylon fan - then get this without question.",m
So very funny!,Z

"There are four pieces in this album.  The first is the iconic ""Addicted to Love"" featuring the late Robert Palmer.  As a tribute, the last is a remix of this by Mel Gaynor.  In the middle of the sandwich are two additional selections by Gaynor.  In my opinion the remix does suffer with the alteration of Palmer's more exotic  beat--a very prominent factor in the original.  However, it's still a great interpretation.",H
It was a great buy since I used to own the cassette tape when I was a little girl. Now the case did arrive cracked as well as broken on the bottom corner where the hinge is. But the CD was perfectly fine. But maybe the seller should wrap it in bubble wrap to ensure safety,\
"I have been listening to New Blood Revival for several years. I only have some of their songs on a CD someone burned for me. If I could, though, I would buy every song they've ever recorded. They're unbelievable!I actually got to see them perform just before the band broke up. They sat down at our table and chatted for a while. Very cool, down-to-earth guys. I wish we could have hung out with them after the show but I was pregnant and in a constant state of exhaustion so I passed up the opportunity and went home instead. If only I had known they were on the verge of a break-up... I would have powered through and stayed!Based on the music I've heard, Matt has a humorously dark and demented mind. Whether he's singing about Jesus stealing his car, using his murdered wife's hair to make fishing flies, killing the guy who taunts him at the laundromat or Satan disguised as the family dog, you are sure to be entertained. Somehow, all those clever lyrics come together in a way that makes the songs so catchy they stick in your head for days.If anyone knows of a way to get more of Matt's/NBR's music, please let me know!!!",N
Great for a Muse fan..but! 2 songs I personally wished were on it..Undisclosed Desires and Feeling Good...,G

"At the age of 8, Nirvana changed my mind about music with ""Nevermind"".  At 13 the world of alternative-rock possessed me when I 'heard Pixies' ""Doolittle"".  When I' was 19, Guided By Voices shook me to the core when I 'finally heard ""Alien Lanes"".  And now my twenties have been completely transformed by one of the best CD's I've discovered throughout my entire musical journey, ""Absolute Bliss""' by (the great &' mighty band) 'wedgepiece.Thank the heavens above for Scot Lade, the hard-hitting driving force behind wedgepiece, for crafting lyrics so universally genius that it's impossible not to be moved by one of the 18 songs featured on this hour long debut.  My craving for radio-pop is satisfied with hits like ""The Stamp Collector"", ""Adina"" and ""Jesse James Canyon"", and Lade can only be credited as an indie messiah for penning such heartbreaking tunes as ""Lament"", ""A Million' Years"", ""Promised Land"" and the addictively catchy ""On Three"".  ""The Ballad of Wedgepiece""' is a witty song addressing the acoustic nature behind the band, but also displays their obvious capability of rocking out.  My favorite song on ""Absolute Bliss"", however, is without a doubt ""I'll Come Running"".  A song about life, love, and pain, it sums up the message behind the CD:' even when everything around you is crumbling, wedgepiece can always make it better.The world will love wedgepiece, male or female.  The raging guitars and powerful vocals drip testosterone, while the sensitive lyrics and buttery voice of Lade make hearts melt.  I was lucky enough to catch a live wedgepiece performance in SW' Florida for their CD release earlier this year, and (besides the amazing show) it was clear that Scot Lade and his band are on a mission 'to wow the masses with one thin, shiny CD at a time.  And let me be the first to say:' WOW!Be superior to all of your indie-blogging friends.  Buy ""Absolute Bliss"" 'now before wedgepiece takes over the world!!!!",X

Strangely, it appears the only album left now is selling for almost 50$ which is nuts. This is a wonderful album, hopefully one day it will be available for all to hear again.

"UPDATED Dec 6, 2017 FOR GRAMMATICAL AND STRUCTURAL REASONS. My views have significantly changed since the writing of this review, and I am a lot more Biblically grounded now. If you're not a Christian, do not concern yourself with that, just read my original review.ORIGINAL REVIEW 2001:Willa(Amanda) Ford, had one thing other female pop singers at the time didn't have, swagger and confidence.  That is ultimately what sank her, that and mediocre material.  She had a unique image, but it is too cartoonish to be taken seriously, and after traditional instrumentation and hard urban music took over after the release of this album, she could never even get close to the success of the single, &#34;I Wanna Be Bad&#34;.This isn't the strongest debut, but it works as collection of self-pronounced egotistical fame hungry Amanda Ford's obsession with fame, predating Lady Gaga's debut by 7yrs. Willa was Officially been dubbed the &#34;Bad Girl&#34; in pop music. While not entirely true,but at least she only has one ballad on the this album.For throwaway pop music, this remains an oddity, and one of the more interesting and unlikely outputs of the early 2000's.  While nothing original or spectacular, it is brash, rude, cocky, egotistical, and idiosyncratic, with blunt comparisons to artists she never had a hope of competing with.What is interesting is that Amanda co-wrote 9 of the 11 tracks here, including the crude &#34; I Wanna Be Bad&#34;, while not crude enough to cause any rela controversy, it was crude enough to keep it from being a bigger hit.. Willa has more of a distinct personality, confidence, and prowress then most of her peers combined.This album is above average for the time it was released, and while it is by-product of it's time, it remains a highlight in a period littered with albums from faceless and personality-less female pop singers. Give Willa a try if you enjoy early 2000's pop. Just because she doesn't have Christina's power vocals doesn't mean she can't sing or that the music is bad for what it is. Willa has a distinctive, but average vocal range, which gives the sometimes mundane material color.God Bless ~Amy",C

"Under Shade is an amazing band.  I can't really place their style.  They sound like they have some Phish influence but with much more depth and not so experimental.  Under Shade doesn't experiment with their sound, they perfect a beautifully organized tune that you can't help moving to.It's refreshing to hear a band that has no trouble leaving the standard 4 - 4 beat pattern and yet is easy to follow.I was introduced to this band by my wife who went to school with the band members.  I've since fell in love with the music and have added it to my short list of timeless albums that never get old.",A

"The obscure mixed with the well-known in a package that will please any fan (or make a new one of the novice) of the Big Band sound across the ocean. We Americans tend to think all the great music of that era came from us, but there were many excellent groups and performers in England, producing a similar but less jazzy music. Surprisingly good vocalists (boy do I want a complete set of Diana Miller records!) and toe-tapping arrangements make this music designed to lift the spirits and warm a chilly Depresssion era UK equally toasty today.A fine bargain too...two very full discs. Good performance info as well, though spartan packaging and notes (hey, whaddya expect?) But a one-stop education about between the wars British music.",^

I am an old (literally) fan and do not know off hand what cuts are on this album of wonder. I'll find out soon enou by listening but by way of any comment at all I would suggest Always list the individual cuts on the collection. The consecutive timing helps too.Sure I'd settle for a clean (louder) recording of this most excellent album no matter what else. i wonder who has my copy to this day?,x

"What can I say about Blackjack that hasn't been covered, possibly more eloquently than I could ever hope to write? I mean yes, we all know that BlackJack launched the career of Michael Bolton, but well, these songs.. they are certainly groovy. As a matter of fact this album has one long groove per side. That's vinyl for you. Yes sir. Blackjack. Even the name itself is two syllables. That is perfect. Why mess with perfect? That's what I say. The Blackjack would have been overkill, and BlackJack would have been a waste of a perfectly good capital J that could be used elsewhere. Buy this album, if it ever comes up for sale. You will then proudly be able to say, yes I made a serious purchase with no goading from a damn critic. Proudly say it loudly. However it's unlikely to happen since this album hasn't been issued in years. Maybe at a yardsale if you are lucky. Really lucky.",K
"Hands down my favorite album of all time. I bought an original copy on here back in 2011 for about $129, and I still have it. The high price tag was because there are supposedly only 1,000 official copies in existence. By &#34;Official Copies&#34;, I mean that it's one of the ones printed back in 2003 when it was released. Not a pirated fake copy which any &#34;seller&#34; could download on numerous Torrent websites all around the web, print the labels on it, and sell it to you.The last song, &#34;Not Alone&#34; which is track 10, contains a 'hidden track' called &#34;Just Sleep&#34; which comes on after about 2 minutes of silence when &#34;Not Alone&#34; finishes - thus making track ten precisely 10 minutes (10:00) in duration. There are only 10 tracks on this album, as opposed to a much older review on here from 2008 featuring the track list which is incorrect. &#34;Just Sleep&#34; does not have it's own track number. &#34;Not Alone&#34; and &#34;Just Sleep&#34; are both in the same track on the album.If you ever see this album for sale anywhere and are a fan of Augustana or even newer bands such as &#34;The Plain White T's&#34;, &#34;Vega4&#34;, &#34;Never Shout Never&#34;, or any other acoustic &#34;Emo-rock&#34; bands, I would highly recommend picking this up. It truly is an extremely rare piece of music. Especially now that Augustana broke up back in 2011, and now comprises only of the lead singer - Dan Layus. All the other guys have gone separate ways. That being said, you likely won't see it commercially available anywhere. But it truly is beautiful music. I love it!",j

"This tour is nothing more than an absolute disaster.  I have no doubt that if fans had known that this show would be so poor before they bought tickets, I bet many people would have opted to skip it.  Madonna tries way too hard this time to be ""hip"" and ""cool"" with sleazy costumes and dance moves, and it just looks embarassing - nobody wants to see a 50-something doing that stuff.  Even worse, the setlist is terrible - filled with songs from her forgettable album ""Hard Candy"" and any of the older songs that she sings are butchered and remixed to the point where they are unrecognizeable.  I don't know about you, but I hate remixes and I definitely hate remixes that make the song sound completely different from the original.  Lastly, the ""choreography"" is lazy and cheesy and just a lot of bump and grind that anyone could do.I find it funny that Madonna's two best tours - Blonde Ambition and Re-Invention STILL have not been released properly on DVD.  If they ever get released, I would recommend getting those instead.",n

"A recent reply to my initial review led me to revisit this cd.  In comparison to the 1990 Capitol two-fer, listening carefully, the Hallmark reissue is way different and from an audiophile standpoint,different..  The Hallmark edition has a strange rechanneling and boost in the midrange which, upon first listening, may appear to have more impact, but I feel that a further remastering from the original multi-tracks would be warranted.",h

"A very nice set with very nice packaging (despite what one of the other reviewers said about flimsy packaging).  Each cd comes individually packaged in a moderately sturdy, printed cardboard sleeve, color-coded by book (blue, red, green, yellow, purple, etc.) with a nice design on the front and a content summary with chapter titles and lengths on the back.  They fit neatly into a very study cardboard case (a lid folds back).  The packaging all has simple but nice artwork on it, and between each book set of dvds is a photo card with black and white pictures of the author and vocal artists.  There is also a bonus cd included with a conversation between Stephen Fry and J.K. Rowling, which I thought was very nice to include and very interesting as well.  In all, there are just over 100 cds.This reading is superbly done, with great expression & emotional inflections and separate voices & accents for each character.  I've found that I would much rather listen to the book being read as I work or walk or drive than to ready the book myself or watch the movies.  Although I know that some people prefer the more recent reading of HP by Jim Dale, but I honestly love Stephen Fry and his deep understanding of people, his humor, and his reading.  He brings all of the accurate detail, humor and magic of the story to life in my head in a way that nothing else could (except his voice for Hermione is a bit high & falsetto, especially in the earlier books, which took some getting used to).  I first heard of this set by borrowing a copy from the library, and I'm so happy I did!  The cost of the product is of course very high, but it's honestly a steal when you consider the hours and hours of professional skill, read-aloud time, practice and preparation, and sound splicing & editing done to create such a smooth, seamless, animated re-reading of a wonderful book.  It is truly remarkable.If you love Harry Potter but don't love reading or want something for long road trips for kids or yourself, this is a high treat and wise investment, and it's becoming increasingly harder to find.  I suggest if you're waiting or wavering to secure a copy before it's too late.",U

"I lived in Norway for a year, and the Scandinavian sour candy is the best bagged candy I've ever had. The stuff you get in the stores is even better...but living in the US now it's impossible to get, so this is a nice extension of that. This is expensive, but worth it if you want to enjoy sour candy that won't tear up your mouth. The funny part is based on the sugar tax in Norway, this price isn't that far off from what I paid living over there, including shipping over the Atlantic. One downside is the small bags, but that's all they have of this over there, and the quality is such that even for a relatively small bag, I don't have any issues.The candy itself is easily five star fantastic, but I removed a star because I ordered 3 bags and didn't get my % discount from the seller. It's a small amount of money so I'm not going to go through the hassle of wasting my time over a dollar or two, but it ruffles my feathers when sellers promise things like that and don't deliver. If that's a concern to you, I wouldn't trust that you'll get the discount. Just get the amount of bags you need and expect to pay full price.",^

"I have had this CD about 1 year and used it twice. The first time to verify all the right sound levels and connections (5 speakers +sub and speaker functionality).The second time I used it to diagnose a subwoofer problem (intermittent) which I could never have found without it.Given the amount of money I (and many others) have in a sound system(s) I want to make sure it is working properly. Normal audio programming will not do this and even my amplifier test mode was not sufficient.It is a little hard to navigate initially but once you get the trick it is not difficult. Recognize all the tracks (82) are listed in the instructions but actually you will probably not use them all. The trick to navigating is to recognize to use the ""next/back"" track functions on your cd/dvd controller to quickly skip over tracks you don't care about. Look at the manual and count how many times you need to press your controller to get there.",T

"This band is a bit more straight forward punk mixed in with the pop elements rather than high energy amped up pop music that bands like Blink 182 ad Sum 41 popularized at apprx the same time this band made it big.  This is one of their first CDs and the minimalist songwriting is more obvious here than it is in some of the later albums, although this band never did go full on open in their songwriting except during a brief period in the mid-2000's i.e.: COMING HOME.  I don't expect Beethoven when hearing rock music, but I do expect the musical arrangements to be a bit more complex than this.  Not a lot more.  The songs are not outright bad.  They just don't ever take off or gain any traction.",R
"Not a *bad* album.  It's hard to find a digital/streaming edition that doesn't sound like garbage.  The whole package rings hollow to me.  It's got catchy rhythms and the echoes of good music running through it, but ultimately it pails very much to their debut.  Their upcoming LOVE IS DEAD, so far, is much better (4 singles and only one of them can be criticized as sounding, to me at least, like background music), and has given me a renewed interest in this album.  I used my sister's Amazon Prime free trial to pre-order the standard edition of this album.  I never even opened it.  I sold it to my local CD buyback headquarters (which is now defunct).  I think sometime I might re-buy this if I can find a good price on it.  I'm in no hurry.",Z

"I fell in love with ""Complicated"" when I was 18 years old in the spring of 2002.  I listened to samples of LET GO, the then-upcoming debut CD which the song was from, via the 'net and for some reason that I can't quite comprehend, felt the other songs weren't worth squat and figured it was one of those CDs where there was one good song with 10 songs that were recorded to give the album the appearance of having a reason for its $15 price tag when a CD single with a $5 price tag would have sufficed for the consumer.  Then in the fall of that year I heard ""Sk8er Boi"" and liked it a lot, looked over the album again, online, and was like ""my God, I need to buy this!  What's wrong with me???!""  I spent the rest of the fall listening to the CD extensively, and then, after enjoying the CD which I paid $17 for when you factor the taxman, sold it to the very store I bought it from for $1.  I'm insane, OK?  Let's not make a big deal of it.So then a couple years later she's got UNDER MY SKIN.  Good CD, doesn't capture the magic of my 18 year old self listening to LET GO in fall of 2002, but it ain't bad.  ""Take Me Away"" and ""Together"" were the big highlights for me, the rest of the album was very listenable tho.Her third CD kinda threw me off in the fact that it lacked all of the introspection of her first two CDs.  I learned to appreciate it for what it is, but nowadays, I find the production to be too muffled.  If the music itself weren't so shallow, it wouldn't be that big of a deal.  The Get Up Kids' SOMETHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT had bad production values, but was a very memorable experience b/c of the music.  But THE BEST DAAA THING didn't have the best songwriting or expressionism, so the songs sounding like they were recorded from the inside of a cardboard box sitting in the midst of a busy street is not something I go back to listen to often at all.Her follow up to that lackluster effort, titled GOODBYE LULLABY, was supposedly a deeper and more introspective Avril Lavigne, and I felt the songs were lacking in originality for one thing, and secondly, the songs were very somber, and, again, the production!: very muddy sounding.  I swear I could hear this kind of ""swoosh"" in the background, like the album cover - featuring a piano stationed in a swamp w/ Avril sitting atop it - was not just an emotive image, but a warning: ""this album sounds like swamp water!"".This song reminds me of LET GO, personally.  It's got the hooks, it's got the emotion, it's got the live-like-u-were-dying attitude of THE BEST DAMN THING and the freshness that should have been found on GOODBYE LULLABY.  It's a great song.  I'm not a big fan of her first single from her upcoming full length, but it's not too shabby either.  It too is better than the songs on GOODBYE LULLABY and the production is superior to that of THE BEST DAMN THING.  I might pre-order her self titled upcoming full length.  I'm like dirt poor so chances are I won't, but I'll just have to see where the wind blows my money (haha).",V

"This is, in my opinion, the single greatest recording of IL TROVATORE ever made, despite the somewhat muffled Italian TV broadcast sound. Why? For one, because Riccardo Muti follows Verdi’s directions explicitly, not only in tempos but in which high notes to allow and not to allow (there are no high notes at the end of “Di geloso amor” or “Di quella pira” because they are not written). But if that were all, I would equally recommend Muti’s 2000 performance, issued by EMI, which also follows the score exactly. The problem was that in the 2000 performance he had an old, wobby baritone (Leo Nucci) and a mezzo with a fluttery, overripe vibrato (Violeta Urmana), whereas in 1977 he had the services of Matteo Manuguerra and Fiorenza Cossotto.This is, in my view, Cossotto’s finest Azucena. Not only does she sing rather more dramatically here than in the past, but for once she sings the trills (most of them, anyway) in “Stride la vampa.” Carlo Cossutta was a good tenor who sometimes pushed the voice too far, as when he sang Otello, but his Manrico is right for him. Manuguerra, one of the greatest Verdi baritones of his time, rarely had the chance to record and, to the best of my knowledge, Gilda Cruz-Romo never made a commercial opera recording. Both are in super voice here, as is basso Augostino Ferrin who likewise sings his shakes in the opening scene. (Cossutta even takes a stab at the trills in “Ah si, ben mio.”)The downside of this recording is the muffled sound. Alas, nothing much can be done about this, because when you try to brighten it up the singers’ high notes begin to “blast” and break up. But I’ve heard and owned far worse-sounding recordings than this, and considering the extremely high quality of the singing and conducting it’s difficult to think of any other TROVATORE nearly as good. Cruz-Romo is especially brilliant, and not just vocally. In the last act, you can hear her heart breaking during the “Miserere” and “Tu vedrai che amore”: it’s quite an acting job, even finer than anything Callas did in this role. It’s the kind of performance that I find is “accumulative,” that is, as you listen to the whole thing in one long session you begin to appreciate what these superb artists were able to bring to the table and how Muti held them all together. Highly recommended.",[
"Good old Amazon, listing reviews of three different “Rigolettos,” none of which is the recording featured on this page (Cotrubas-Domingo-Cappuccilli, Sutherland-Pavarotti-Miles, Popp-Aragall-Weikl). Well, let’s review the actual recording at hand, shall we?I was scouring the Internet to re-listen to Leonard Warren’s 1950 studio recording of “Rigoletto” when I accidentally tripped across this one. I admit having my doubts, as much as I loved Warren’s interpretation of the title role, because I know from bitter experience that both Bidu Sayão and Jussi Björling had a bad tendency to distort the music in live performances. I had also never heard any opera conducted by Cesare Sodero, and wondered if he would be better or worse than the miserable Emil Cooper and Fritz Stiedry who succeeded him at the Met. Imagine my surprise to discover an oustanding performance fairly bursting with drama!First and foremost, of course, is Warren in the title role. Here his voice is even fresher than it was in 1950 and he revels in the character. His “Cortigianni” is sung with the imagination and sensitivity of a great lieder singer: listen to the way he colors his tones, pulls back on the volume, then lunges forward. He begins his inventive with both anger and hurt in his voice, and ends with a pleading tone that will break your heart. He doesn’t have the technique to sing “Si, vendetta” with the rapid triplets, but he does something even more interesting: he starts it softly and slowly, gradually building up a head of steam as Gilda begins to realize what he is singing about and does her best to dissuade him. A very dramatically interesting moment.Sayão, for the most part, is surprisingly clean here. Granted, she occasionally indulges in her little sobs and whines which so mar her live Met performances, but in this instance they are at a minimum and, when done, they actually enhance the drama. Gilda is, after all, a 16-year-old, shelted young woman who is abducted and raped by the brutish Duke. The fatal flaw in her character is her inability to let the S.O.B. die when he should have. She sings but one false note, the very last one at the end of “Caro nome” where she goes badly flat; otherwise, her singing is musically accurate and surprisingly touching. One of her few great performances.Björling is Björling. His small voice, well recorded, fairly explodes with energy and brilliant color, and he impresses himself on you with tremendous vitality, but he—more so than Sayão—often indulges in holding notes longer than their written duration. It’s a small price to pay, however, for such an overwhelmingly committed performance.Sodero is a bit relaxed in places but overall conducts a well-paced performance. His reading of the storm scene in the last act is as powerful as Toscanini’s, and he elicits surprisingly fine playing from the generally third-rate Met Opera Orchestra and chorus of that era. A shame he died two years later at the age of 61, leaving the Italian wing of the Met open to the arrival of that stick-in-the-mud Stiedry.The two biggest drawbacks are, of course, the 1945 broadcast sound, which is clear but two-dimensional and somewhat “hissy,” and the fact that the Met not only allowed but encouraged cuts in the music. Not only are “E il sol dell’anima” and “Addio, addio” cut, so too are “Tutte le feste” and other moments. And of course, “Possenti amor mi chiamo” doesn’t even exist in this era.That being said, this is still the historic “Rigoletto” of choice—much better than any of the mono studio recordings made between 1928 and 1956 (yes, even better than the overrated Callas-Gobbi recording, mostly because Giuseppe di Stefano sings the rhythms wrong in the Act 1 Scene 1 finale and in “Parmi veder le lagrime”). My favorite recording of all time, however, is the DVD version with Paolo Gavanelli, Christine Schäfer, Marcelo Alvarez and conductor Edward Downes, but for those who know of it there is also another superb version made back in the 1970s with the vastly underrated soprano Margherita Rinaldi, Rolando Panerai and Franco Bonisolli.",y
"Since Amazon seems to have placed reviews here of performances by Bruno Walter and Karl Böhm, I thought it might be nice to have a review of this actual recording.This live performance of October 12, 1953 is in most ways not only superior to Furtwängler’s studio recording, begun the next day and made over a week, but also shows what is wrong with most other recordings and performances (including the Toscanini, Klemperer and Abbado versions). Not only does the conductor pace the opera effectively (though, being Furtwängler, not perfectly), but he knows how to BUILD DRAMA, not only with the orchestra but also with a superb cast of singers who not only have fine voices but also create CHARACTERS. Granted, Windgassen isn’t quite as fine a Florestan as Jon Vickers, but then, no one was…certainly not Julius Patzak, who bleats his way through the role on the highly-overrated 1950 performance. Martha Mödl is possibly the finest Leonore on records, to my mind even better than Flagstad in either her 1941 or 1950 performances, although Flagstad sings nobly and with commitment.In five places I found Furtwängler’s studio performance a bit better: the second half of the opening Jacquino-Marzelline duet, the Rocco-Pizarro duo, the “Abscheulischer” and prisoner’s chorus (Mödl is too far off-mike in the live performance) and the vocal portion (but not the orchestral introduction) of “Gott! Welch dunkel hier.” Otherwise, this live performance has it all over the studio version. Not only are Furtwängler’s tempos more consistent and less erratic (his fans well know that he had a bad habit of speeding up and slowing down the music at whim, for no particularly good reason), but in most cases there is more energy, feeling, and forward momentum in this live performance has an undercurrent of menace missing from most of the studio version. The sound quality is certainly not optimal but better overall than the RAI “Ring.” But by and large, this is a performance to obtain for the three most important principals, Leonore, Pizarro and Florestan, along with some wonderful conducting. I only gave it four stars because of the limited mono sound—good for its day, but not optimal. As an overall performance, I still prefer the Flagstad-Maison-Bruno Walter performance, but this one has Martha Mödl (and better sound) which gives it an edge to those who won’t be able to stand 1941 radio transcription disc sonics",y
"The year was 1956.  The world was arguing the merits of Maria Callas vs. Renata Tebaldi - the power of dramatic interpretation vs. a beautiful voice - when an entirely new soprano burst on the scene.  She was still very young, only 26 years old, and had a huge lirico spinto voice of enormous power and focus.  She was also highly musical, meaning that she did not take liberties with tempo or stretching the line; she had an excellent technique for a voice so large, lacking only a cleanly defined trill.  And she could drive audiences to the point of madness over the sound and fire in her voice.  Her name was Anita Cerquetti.Like the young Callas, she was very heavy, topping the scales at about 250 lbs, and she wasn't very pretty.  Yet all that was forgiven when she opened her mouth and sang.  Within two years, Cerquetti became the darling of both Italian audiences and musicians, each of which admired her for different reasons.  She lacked the almost demonic madness of Callas, yet still came within hailing range of the great Greek-American diva.  And she sang an incredible range of roles, from Cherubini to verismo, all with impeccable taste and flawless execution.  In 1958, after Callas' infamous ""Rome walkout"" in a production of ""Norma"" for which the management had hired no understudy, Cerquetti was subsequently rushed in to take over the role.  She did so with aplomb, marking herself as one of the great singing-actresses of the age.By 1960, it was all over.  At age 30, Cerquetti suffered a strange malady, paralysis of her vocal cords.  Doctors were baffled in one so young, but ascribed it to over-singing.  Cerquetti gracefully retired from the stage, leaving behind only two commercial recordings - an opera recital that showed her gifts to full advantage, and a complete recording of Ponchielli's ""La Gioconda"" that didn't - and several ""live"" recordings in which her powers were in full bloom.  This recital draws from those sources, a 1958 recital in which she sang the aria from ""La Wally"" and ""O Re de Cieli"" from Spontini's ""Agnese di Hohenstaufen,"" one of her signature encore pieces, as well as several famous complete performances, among them Cherubini's ""Gli Abencerragi"" conducted by Giulini, Weber's ""Oberon"" (in Italian) conducted by Gui, Verdi's ""Ernani"" conducted by Mitropoulos, ""Forza del Destino"" conducted by Sanzogno, ""I Vespri Siciliani"" conducted by Mario Rossi.  These were legendary performances, then; they remain vital and tremendously exciting today.  No soprano since, not even Elena Suliotis or Carol Vaness or Karita Mattila, has quite captured the qualities that Cerquetti brought to the world.  She was like Deborah Voigt in overdrive, just as big and beautiful a voice with all the passion and dramatic fire that Voigt so often lacks.Anita Cerquetti settled down, got married and had children after her early retirement.  Five years later, her voice came back, but she had no proclivity to revive her career.  How could she possibly have topped, or even equaled, what she had done?  Better to let sleeping dogs lie and let her reputation rest on her youthful accomplishments.  And what accomplishments they were.  I defy you to listen to this recital and not be moved, thrilled, and appreciative of her great gifts.  By the time you are in the cabaletta of ""Mare, superbo mare"" (""Ozean zu ungeheuer"" in Italian), your heart will be in your throat.  Cerquetti had that kind of effect on her listeners.  She grabbed them in her thrall and did not let go until she stopped singing.  The spell still works after a half-century; Cerquetti is still great.This is a desert-island recital.  Put it alongside your Callas, Chaliapin, Vickers, Gobbi and Terfel records.  They are the only singers who were in her class; they represent an operatic world gone and vanished, like a morning mist burned off by the sun, but in this case the mist has been bottled and preserved for future enjoyment - if, indeed, anyone in the future will care much.  Anita Cerquetti was one of a kind.",e
"I initially heard a Tuff song from an internet radio station and thought I would check them out.  This album is great with some really awesome songs.  However the recording sounds like it may have been from a tape or maybe just lower quality.  There's some high pitched feedback on some of the songs that make it a little difficult to listen to.  The CD showed up autographed with a couple of buttons, which was super badass.",p
To describe this album in one word: Dull. Monotonous. Irritating. Take your pick.,[
"This CD has been one of my favorites and it is an old CD.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon as I wanted to order several copies for next year's Christmas presents!  It arrived well within the alloted time frame and was very well packaged.  Amazon continues to be one of my favorite shopping sources.... Thanks much, EP",m
Love it!,B

"reminds me of my mother and grandparents, the songs they sang and records they played.  a couple brought me to tears because i remember my mother singing with ""Tennessee"" Ernie Ford - How Great Thou Art, Precious Lord.  those 2 were songs she sang to my children when they were infants until she died.  they still remember her singing to them.",c

"Wow... just wow.. this band swings like h....!!!For starters, let's talk about the choice of tunes... ""Woodchopper's Ball,"" ""One O'Clock Jump,"" ""Two O'Clock Jump,"" ""Intermission Riff,"" etc., all borrowed from the masters of the Swing Era. There's no doubt that Kaempfert puts the usual touch with the strings and chorus that came to be his hallmarks but don't let that deter you from the fact that this rhythm section drives these hard swinging tunes like a well-oiled machine. The brass cuts through like a razor sharp knife and the reeds are every bit as impressive.It's a great album, well-recorded and executed the way a big band recording ought to be. The only weak link in the chain are the original tunes towards the end, which, in my opinion, lack the spark that Kaempfert's tip-o-the-hat to his American big band idols possess. Even so, it's an enjoyable trip back in time and you'll be smiling ear to ear.... or rolling up the rug for an extended jitterbug session.In short, love it!",S
"For Boswell Sisters and Connee Boswell fans, this album is a ""must have,"" for this is Miss Boswell's final album. After this LP was cut, she only made one more commercially released record, a 45RPM single on the independent Charles label from 1963.For those new to the Boswell legacy, you will be interested to know that Connee had been making records since 1925, so when this Design album hit the market in 1958, she was already a well-established and highly influential jazz and popular singer. Her career had spanned several recording companies, with her first record (along with her sisters Martha and Vet, the Boswell Sisters) was made in New Orleans in 1925 for Victor. There were a few sides released on the Okeh and Victor labels in 1930, then a series of records by Connee and the Boswell Sisters on Brunswick and Decca. After the Boswell Sisters broke up in 1936, she continued recording for Decca until 1946, briefly recorded a few sides for Apollo, returned to Decca in 1951-1956, back to RCA Victor and finally, two LP's made for Design in 1958.When this record was released, jazz and vocal big band standards still somewhat shared the charts with Rock and Roll, though the era of the jazz pop vocalist was passing. Also, Connee was past her prime and as one fan has said, the fabric of her voice had begun to unravel by the time this record was made. That's not to say her singing isn't top knotch-- she does a fine job here but this isn't her best work.The tracks:Everything I've Got Belongs to YouYou're NearerI Could Write a BookMy Funny ValentineI Didn't Know What Time It WasMy RomanceThe Lady Is a TrampBewitchedWhere or WhenThere's a Small MotelMy personal favorite is ""Where or When.""As to the recording quality itself, the records are available in high fidelity mono or hi-fi stereophonic; however, I will warn any purchaser of the LP's (or the less common reel-to-reel) that the stereo versions suffer from exceptionally poor engineering, what might be best described as an experimental stereo, resulting in odd effects and at times, Connee being drowned out by the orchestra. This makes the listening experience less than stellar.So all of that being said, you decide you want to give a listen but you don't have a record player or reel-to-reel player? Since this album has never been released on a properly remastered CD with this cover, you'll have to shop around for a long out-of-print CD called ""An Evening with Connee Boswell,"" on the Pickwick label.Enjoy!",T

"My mom bought this box set when I was just a kid. As I got older, I would play these on my little record player, over and over. Sometimes, I would cry as I sang along. I loved them so much.

I have hours and hours of lullaby material. Thanks, Simon & Garfunkel!",[

I remember listening this album back in 1979 and was addicted the all the songs.  Such great classics - every song on this album.  Listened to the album again last night.  It was like being back in 70s/80s again.  If you from that era you will enjoy it.,f

Nice to find a very well coordinated collection of first class music by a very talented artist like Anna Hawkins.Rare in this day to have a great team arrange a work such as this devoted to God.The bonus tracks alone are worth the price of the CD in my humble opinion.Very pleased with the purchase.,Z

"Larry Norman is cited as having the first major label Jesus Music release on Capitol Records in 1968. Shortly after that, a small church in Costa Mesa, California would suddenly find itself the epi-center of the Jesus Movement in the United States, with tremors that are still being felt today!Under the watchful eye of pastor Chuck Smith, a new record label was born to be used to spread the music that was being birthed at Calvary Chapel. Those first two albums were ""The Everlasting Living Jesus Music Concert"" and ""Maranatha! 2"". Those two classic albums, which launched the careers and ministries of artists like Love Song, The Way, Children Of The Day, Gentle Faith and Debby Kerner plus many others, are included on this first of four ""Collections"", which include all but one song that were included on the first seven Maranatha! albums.Over all, the transfer to digital and remastering is quite nice, with only a few ""defects"" and wobbles from the original two track master tapes apparent. These re-issues were only sold in limited numbers and will not be re-issued again, so they are becoming quite collectible AND expensive so if you don't have a copy yet, the longer you wait, the more it may cost you.

"Wow, wow wow!!  A product that actually delievers on it's claim.  From the moment this CD started I could feel the absolutely pristine sound cleansing the atmosphere.  So let me tell you, I'd had challenges in my kitchen.  A year and a half ago on the coldest night of the entire winter the neighbor upstairs pipe froze and burst and completely flooded my kitchen.  My kitchen had to be gutted from ceiling to 2 walls to floor.  Some new wiring all new cabinets it was a total remodel.  I had to move out of the condo it was so extensive.  Then, just a little over a year later, there was a slow leak in the wall that caused problems in my newly remodeled and beautiful kitchen.  Not normal to have two such events and so close together.  It has taken a while to deal with this and it's still not totally done.  I thought I'd like to play this CD in the kitchen and yes!  It has cleansed the energy and it feels so nice in there once again.  This CD is available from Billy Topa Tate's center in Evanston, IL.  They sent it quickly.  One more thing, this may be just me, but I find I like to play this Enhancement at a much lower and softer level than I use for music.  It seems more mysterious and effective at a soft volume.  Very effective and cleansing.",N
This CD is defective.  It plays the first two songs okay.  The 3rd one you wait about 1 minute (60 seconds) and it starts to play.  The rest of the CD doesn't play at all - just a series of clicks.  I'd like to return it for a full refund including shipping.  Hopefully this particular CD is a dud.,B

"This is a good introduction to the world of classical piano.  You get to hear at least two very fine pianists -- Earl Wild and Ralph Votapek.  The sound is average.  The vinyl of the album was my introduction to the world of classical piano.  There are some interesting pieces here.  The truncated version of the Rach #2 works for me.  I was surprised when I heard the real, longer version.  The Slaughter on 10th Avenue piece is rarely performed and this is a good version.  All in all, if you want to get someone started on a musical journey, this is a good gift.",i
"This is a nice collection of obscure 20th century works by American composers, for small orchestra.  The sound is not sumptuous, but it is clear, and the interpretations are convincing.  Standouts are Nicholas Flagello's Adoration,  Barlow's Winter's Passed, and Wilson's Dedication.  It is a somber, evocative album, good for a winter night by the fire.  I would call the bulk of the music neo-romantic, mostly tonal with some dissonance.  If you are looking for something different, this is pretty good.",h
"If you love Grieg's orchestral versions of these pieces, you'll equally love the piano versions played here by Katsaris.  His playing is crisp, but never loses the romantic side of these compositions.  The warm piano sound is very good.  I have owned this disc since it came out 30 years ago and it has never lost its charm.",I
"This has become a favorite in our house.  We listened to it twice in a row the first two times we put it on.  Summer has a clear, lyrical voice.  Purists will say it is not an A+ voice it sure is pleasant to listen to.  An obvious comparison is with Katherine Jenkins, and Ms. Jenkins has a somewhat stronger voice, but I slightly prefer the softer edges of Summer's voice.  I think this will appeal to both fans of classical and pop music.",O

"Barbara Rosene obviously enjoys these old songs. Her voice is unique in its clarity and beauty.  And the recorded sound by Jim Czak is so vivid that you'll feel like Barbara and her splendid musicians are in your living room with you.  You can almost imagine that you are back listening to Ruth Etting or other remarkable women who sang with the great music groups of the 1920s and 1930s.

"This is Tim before he got a bit commercial.  Each of his three early albums are an eclectic mix of blues, rock, and unique meanderings.",Q
My folks loved it. They were dancing to Li'L Wally back in their younger days. Thank you.,H
Great! My wife and I saw them in person multiple times.,c
"This collection of guitar music from William Elwood and another artist are so soothing! I purchased it because I've had other CDs by William Ellwood and enjoyed them very much. While each piece is different, they've been chosen to blend very well, one after the other. (There's nothing more jarring when listening to a CD than to have some crashing music after a gentle piece!) I play this music when I'm drawing or painting and it is great to help me let go of stress and get into the beauty of color and design. I think it'd also be good during meditation (which art is for me.)",D
Heard her in the city and bought the album on the spot from her.,z
Loved the music. Great CD. The sleeve it came in was cheap and too small. I had to cut down the sides to get it out. Not a good idea.,I

"If you saw this stage production in person. You will love the album. I used to have it when it was first out, but over the years it had gotten lost. The used vinyl is near perfect. Only a couple of small clicks on a track. I had forgotten I owned the album when it was new. But, I knew the words of every song as it played. Wonderful memories for me. The only Broadway show I have ever seen in person.",n
"LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME was made famous by Sammy Davis, Jr. in the fifties. Nina Simone put out her version and it topped the lists. I was glad to get this, even on vinyl. It isn't on any of her CDs. I wore it out in the early 60's. The other side is I LOVES YOU PORGY.",O

"This is an excellent collection of songs from a doctor/lawyer combo called ""Depression Glass.""  Jeff Mead's heartfelt vocals and Scott McAndrew's technical wizardry make this one a winner!The original and remakes are both outstanding on this CD.  I am glad this CD is available on amazon. That will allow more people to discover the great melodies and words that I have discovered! :)",h
Shipped fast and Cd worked. My brother introduced me to this Cd. He been in the military his entire life. The songs are pretty cool and  perfect  for a 4th July barbecue or any day honoring the America troops. I did have 1 problem is that my Cd case broke right away. It's cheaply made I hate to say but I didn't knock any points off because of it,U
Great album. Bought it for a gift,O
Excellent CD!!!  Great condition!  Bought several others for friends who also went head over heels in love with this CD!,a
"We had this album on cassette as kids and always loved it.  It was the best ""road trip music.""  Now, I have the CD for my son and he loves it, too.  He is only 2 and knows several of the songs by heart and often asks to hear the ""Amen song.""  I'm happy to be able to share the music I loved as a kid with my kids.",A
"One of my absolute favorites for relaxing and thinking through life. I have heard my share of cheesy relaxing music. This cd is not the same. It is filled with soft melancholy piano music with thunder,rain and birdsong in the background. I have had it for over 6 years and still love listening to it.",^
"An absolute masterpiece. I love Eric Carmen’s music. I would go back and forth to Penn State listening to this cassette on my old Walkman to the point that I recalled every song on this record by heart. One time I was in a bus going to college and the driver yelled at me to turn my headset down, “personalize it,” I recall him saying and I laughed. This was that kind of record. I got totally lost in it and every song is a good one. One reviewer did not like “I Want To Hear It From Your Lips” which was the single that got a lot of air play on VH1 which was in the mid 80’s sort of an MTV for a more grown up sound. I loved the video and the single. I agree there are good ballads on this record too like “She Remembers” which is an ode to seeing a high school love at a reunion and having that moment at a reunion where you feel that feeling of why she was important to you even though the relationship has ended. Bottom line: this is a great Eric Carmen recording from the mid 1980’s. Buy it!",v
Came to house very fast,s
"Secondhand News is such an astonishing song, doctors should prescribe it to depressed patients. It is not possible to feel down listening to it.The opening guitar notes announce that the singer of Monday Morning and Blue Letter (perfectly great songs) has found a way to re-sort all of that ...into a giant, propulsive, pounding masterpiece.",q
"KREEPKREEPSHOW-THE LOST ALBUM1.INTRO-excellent instrumental intro with some familiar horror movie music, you will know it when you hear it. Produced by Boondok.2.RACKS ON RACKS-the first track comes out knocking like crazy. Kreep tears up every verse and also produced the instrumental. This one would have been a great single. I could see this one getting a lot of views with the right video.3.STACK THE PAPER-this one was produced by Hostyle ad has that classic West Coast feel to it. Kreep spits about getting that money with Doc Holiday. This is a nice smooth track to roll to, another great song.4.ON ONE-Kreep is back on production and this is a thumper right here. This one has that Hyphy feel to it. Kreep comes correct with King Duce Boyz. This is another one like track two that could have been a cool single. I could have seen this one banging in the clubs.5.THE SOLUTION-Kreep drops a darker sounding beat on this one finally matching the cover art of this album and that intro. Kreep and Skillz deliver hard on this one with that darker street spit. Skillz in particular sounds great over Kreep’s production here.6.OFFICIAL-the song that I bought the album for back in the day as Brotha Lynch Hung comes right out the gate spitting that real over Kreep’s excellent beat. This one right here should have had a video for sure. The beat is great and the hook is catchy with Lynch, Kreep, Skee 64 and The Illiacs killing this track. This is probably my favorite song on the album.7.SUPER FLY LIKE-Kreep sounding great again over his banging instrumental. This one is another banger with Kreep and Young Game dropping some great verses. You will recognize a sample on this track, maybe from a few 90’s era Hip Hop tracks that were popular.8.GANGSTAS-this one to me fits the style of the cover as it makes me think of a messed up carnival for some reason. Kreep goes solo on this one over his kinda eerie production. I really like this one for some reason although it is not my favorite.9.HOES-Kreep and Young Game team up once again over another self produced track from Kreep. This one is kind of a dance style beat but a little darker. I am sure you can guess what this track is about based on the title. Young Game sounds really comfortable over this beat, his flow here makes me think this could have been another single.10.CLAP, CLAP-we get another club type beat and song with that darker tone to it. I really like Kreep as a producer I have come to learn. Kreep does his thing of course as does Yaberation who kinda sounds like Yukmouth to me, especially his backup vocals and adlibs.11.CAN I SHINE-once again Kreep goes solo over another self produced track. This one also features the style of the album based on the cover and name of the album. This is a cool piano driven track,12.CITY OF RIVERS-Kreep gives another club type beat for himself and Nino Tha Block Kontrolla to rip up and bounce to. This is a nice bouncy type track that I am sure most would enjoy.13.HANDLE DIS-straight West Coast right here with Kreep dropping that beat and first verse here. This is also the track were we get Legend Keak Da Sneak on the album. Keak takes that second verse followed by Lameez on that final verse. This is another good song on a strong album.14.HAVIN BABIES-Kreep telling some real stories right here, kinda his “Brenda’s got a Baby” type track. This one was produced by Night Train and while different it fits the album well.15.PAY ME-Kreep and Young Game are at it again this time spitting it for the ladies. A more fun instrumental this time from Keep but they still sound great together. Another solid track for the album.16.GET PECOS-this is another banger that could have been a single with Kreep going dolo again both on production and rhyming. Obviously you know what the song is about. Another great song on a strong album.17.NEXT 2 U-Kreep producing another club track for the ladies with a nice catchy hook by J Malik who also gets a verse here on a potential single. I love the shout out to the late Mac Dre here, bouncy track.18.JUAN GUATEMALA-Jay G drops a Latin flavored instrumental here and Kreep sounds excellent over this. This for sure should have been a single, I could see a video for this that would have been great.19.DOUBLE DIP-Kreep himself produces the final song on the album and the beat reminds me of something but I can’t think of it. Kreep and Mr. Imakulent do their thing on here and end the album kinda on a humorous note I think.20.OUTRO-excellent instrumental outro that I assume was produced by Boondok but I am not sure.This was a stronger album than I remembered with some good production and verses. The album has a mix between styles of songs from club stuff to serious stuff. The album cover and the knowledge of Lynch being here leads one to believe it would be a darker album but one would be wrong.",t

"I used to go to a hypnotherapist. I've tried various self hypnosis cds since he retired and Blenn Harold's are THE BEST. I go under after about two minutes and wake up the second it's over. I feel a lot better, refreshed and yes the message does up lift me. I have two of his. I wore wone out and ordered it again. I've tried various CDS like this but his are by far the very best, truly matching my session with my old hynpotherapist.I don't normally lie on a bed during the day and just drop off; I'm going under as I do his breathing and my subconscious is picking up his message. On a few occassions I wasn't totally under and I heard the message in full and its as if he tailor made this for me.",v

I ordered this because I heard her cover of Shocking Blue's &#34;Send Me A Postcard&#34; and loved it.  Amy is from the Detroit area and I like to support local talent. I was hoping that at least half the CD would be good and was surprised to find that I like all the tracks. This is fresh music with a little 80s punk meets 60s girl group and some Shal Talmy British invasion mixed in.,P

Would not be good for anyone who isn't already interested in Rupert Spira's talks and work.

"Mamie Van Doren is one hot broad. You watch any of her movies and she could hands down beauty wise beat Manesfield and Monroe. I got this CD because in some of her movies I remember hearing the music and some of it was good. I said some. This CD has a high camp factor which in my book places it above all others yet the music brought my rating down a bit. Out of the 16 songs on the CD 10 were good and I make a judgement usually if at least half of the songs on a album are good I haven't wasted my money. In this case I haven't. The CD starts off with ""Nobody but You"" a steamy swingin' love ballad that got my beatnik bop sunglasses steamed up. The way she sings on this track got my blood boiling. Then there is a bit of a Rockabilly twang on ""Rolling Stone"" and then it really starts to rock on Do Ba La Baby written by Eddie Cochran. The background singing is stupid but the rest of the song is great. Beat Generation is a song in the jazz vain that rips into the beatniks a put down obviously written by some square musician. ""Something to Dream about"" is slightly erotic and the song is OK it is one of the better ones. ""Salamander"" is a pretty rocking one and a good rip on us men. Then theres the hilarious song ""The Bikini with No Top on the Top"" a pop song sung with June Wilkinson made me laugh but at the same time made me hot under the collar. The best song though is the awesome storming instrumental ""So What Else is New?"" Where some guys are cat calling at Mamie and June and in the off hand hot chick way they reply ""What Else is New?"" Then the instrumental just rips. All in all not bad. The rest of the songs aren't noteworthy. Their gauzy banal pop ballads from the 50's the worst kind of music the beats and Rockabillys rebelled against. However the above mentioned songs are awesome. A Fly by Night Dutch company re-issued this from vinyl and it is hard to find. It really pisses me off that good music goes out of print so some dumbass can charge 100 dollars for 15 dollar item. If you are fan of camp music like I am get this if you see it. It is well worth it.",X
"If you are a fan of the Wave music from the 1980s this Men At Work collection would be one to add to your library.While I’m not really a fan of Men At Work compared to so many of bands from the 80s, it’s a nice offset to listen to material every so often.",x
"Just about anything Adrian Belew was involved with in the 1980s is well worth your while. The first Bears album is no exception. In fact it’s pretty damn good and the better of the two Bears albums.Sadly, this album has been out of print for many years. If you are a fan of Belew and you run across this somewhere, be sure to snatch it up.",j
"If there would be only one Alice Cooper album to get, Billion Dollar Babies is this the one.The amount of good music that was produced in the early 1970s has a certain unsurmountable edge on the period of classic rock that would decline 5 years later. Billion Dollar Babies is no exception and fits right in with the Apex of Classic Rock music. It's a great album.",m
"Third in succession of the early Fixx albums, Phantoms is a fairly comparable and complementary disc to Reach the Beach. That is to say if you like the first two Fixx albums, you’ll like this one.The guitar work of Jamie West Oram once again stands out. While I am not a big Strat guy, in my mind Oram’s manipulation of the Stratocaster sticks out as some of the best application of the instrument from the early 80s. He evokes a huge tone.Presently it would appear the only early Fixx album available in CD format in its entirety is Reach the Beach. I suppose the compilation Fixx CD collections are just as wonderful. But Phantoms and a number of other Fixx albums could stand to be reissued. They are that good.Meanwhile, Phantoms and other Fixx albums represent a refreshing genre of music that was coming out in the early 80s. And for those that love Pop and Progressive Rock, this album should fit right in. I highly recommend this CD.",A
"Finding all of Johnny Winter’s albums is not the easiest undertaking. While some albums are more attainable, others are not. John Dawson Winter III is one of the hardest to find and at good price.The album itself is a missing link of sorts for Winter with it being the last studio album he did with the McCoys. Winter was to do a couple of live albums with this clan after, one being with his brother Edgar. But this album marks the end of Winter’s Rock era when he transition to something more of a full on Blues player. But this album has become something of an obscurity to the Johnny Winter catalog. Why? Who knows. There are some inconsistencies with the production as there are some changing lineups in personnel throughout. But none less it is a great album.",c
"The title collection might be deceiving. There is plenty of material from Ram and McCartney’s first album. So it’s not just a Wings compilation.I bought this collection because the single disc of Band On the Run issue does not contain Helen On Wheels, but I digress…If you are looking for a greatest hits sort collection of McCartney’s material, this would be as fair as any of good place to start.",v
"ZZ Top’s first album is well worth you time.There are aspects to this album that are better than its follow up album. And if you like the early ZZ Top, you’ll like this.",[
"I loved this album back around the time it came out. I still appreciate it now in conjunction with the rest of Elton John’s catalog from the mid 70s. However, I wouldn’t say this was one of John’s better moments. The two albums that sandwich Caribou, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and Captain Fantastic are better acclaimed, musical accompaniments, IMO.There are a lot good tunes on caribou. Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on me is a masterpiece while The Bitch is Back is dumb Pop stuff. Another interesting song on this album I always like is the ballad Ticking, a song about a mentally disturbed young man. Well done.Anyway, Caribou is a good record in compliment to the other Elton John albums from the time period.",V
"If you are a fan of the records Joe Meek produced, you'll love this collection.",D
"If this record didn’t spawn a major impact on the history of Rock music...You already know about this breakthrough album by Van Halen after their raise to the top of the heap of the LA Rock scene in the later 1970s. But the tone of this band and album is phenomenal for how simple the recording process was.Perhaps from a critic’s point of VH is a bit more on the Pop bent, but their sound is nothing short of huge.",O
"The information is good, but the yellow CD pictured are the latest version and the one I received was an older set.

"If your looking at KTel vinyl, your not in it for the pristine sound lol!It's the pure fun of looking back,KTel will always hold a place in my heart from the years in my childhood when I was experiencing new music,Don't be offended by the substandard sound, often asking yourself ""how did that song get on this album?""It's a great trip down memory lane!Any one of them!I'm a collector of them all... Love them",k
"Along with the great Sabicas on the record alblum: ""Day of the Bullfight,"" is the late great Pepe Segundo, who was tragically killed in an automobile accident in his early thirties...Never have I heard a greater flamenco singer with the vocal range that Pepe had...He had no peer, not even Cameron de la Isla could match Pepe's voice...If you want to hear him at his best, just listen to the bulerias (coffee shop) on this album to prove my point...Not only is Pepe fantastic to hear, but Sabicas is playing one of his fastest bulerias' I have ever heard and I have heard all of Sabicas' record albums...There is also another three pieces on the record where Pepe sings...Being a flamenco guitarist myself, I wish I had heard Pepe sing in person while he was alive...It is a shame that this ABC Paramount recording has not been reissued on a CD...This record is very rare...I already have it so I won't deprive some lucky person from buying it...I can't begin to tell you how great this recording is...There is also at the beginning of each piece an orchestral introduction of bullfight music which adds to the overall atmosphere of the recording....",N
"Got this when it came out, and am still enjoying it 20 years later.  Less timbral and more in the classical western composer tradition, it has stood the test of time for me.",w
"My CD of A.R. Rahman's RAANJHANAA arrived today in New Zealand where winter snow has begun. Thanks to Rahul & I - Indian Music House. I am a huge fan of Rahman and have listened to practically all his music. This new release is wonderful, a return to more folk India - and some of the melodies feel familiar. I was delighted to hear great Sitar. Only Rahman can weave the classical Indian sound with his original and fresh creativity to perfection. Rahman always invites many listenings. I would imagine the best talent in India, like Shreya Ghosal, line up to perform with Rahman. Indeed it must be a pleasure to work with a genius composer who is also a kind generous humanitarian. What would our crazy world be without his music?I am a sap for his romantic melodies, so NAZAR LAAYE appeals to me right away. But as always Rahman's inventive layered orchestrations lie waiting to be discovered. Many of these songs are a bit reminiscent of earlier favorites, with fragrances of remembered phrases that haunt the memory. All in all a happy and enjoyable collection of songs. In praise of Rahman!",t
"This is probably my most favorite album of all time.  I had a copy, but 'someone' managed to lose the sleeve.  I'm so happy to have this, and it was lovingly packaged.  Thank you!",S
As noted by others this is the real deal here and the sound quality is amazing over the standard Legend of 1900 CD missing the extra songs. Well worth the price.,o

"Our Song... as another reviewer rightly said, is a high point on the album, and this is quite possibly the only place to hear it on CD at this time.Jack always delivers, and this is a very strong collection of songs.

"Bought this for 'Andromeda', which is also known as Odyssey Part 1 by Johnny Harris (which you can look up an listen to on 'u-toob').  This is the song played by the band in the 'Space Rockers' episode and is great, but it's electronic disco and not rock.  Aside from this song and the opening/closing music, the rest of the 3 cd's contains the fluff music from a handfull of episodes.  A few of those fluff songs are o.k., but I'd never have bought this if the 'Andromeda' song wasn't on it.Liner notes are great.  Cover artwork is great.  Inner holder for the middle disc is too tight, which wouldn't be a problem if I hadn't wanted to actually play the cd.The music, itself, is very clean and has a great dynamic range for its age.  No hisses, snaps or pops.  Original reels were either fantastic or someone spent some time restoring the sound.Technically great.  Music... depends on how much you enjoy the show or if you're looking for a particular song like I was.",y
"I wanted the 'I Hate You' song, that wasn't on the original soundtrack.  Only a couple other decent tracks on the cd, but nothing that was worth listening to (just my opinion as I would have given it a 3.5 out of 5).  The first three movies had far better music scored for them.  Liner notes were great.  Cover art is great.Better soundtracks (orchestral pieces):2046 (Mixture of old and new / European and Asian)The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover (depends on your ears)BladerunnerBrainstormDonnie DarkoAkira (Japanese)AliensBatman (Original score)Battlestar Galactica (the new series)Bleu / Rouge / Blanc (French trilogy... Bleu is the best of the three)Braveheart / Gladiator / Lord Of The Rings (Epic type music)Dune (Toto)E.T.Ghost In The Shell (Movie... although the t.v. series is good too)Halloween (Who knew J. Carpenter could create a catchy tune)HardwareKoyaanisqatsi (P. Glass)The Good, The Bad And The UglyLabyrinthMishima (P.

Sounds good!,l
It’s an awesome CD of prince.  Prince had a awesome band.  These are awesome songs to listen to all day.  I love Diamonds and Pearls. As well as 1999 and When Doves Cry. Would not mind listening to this all day.  If not other CDs Prince and the Revolution did.,q
"It's good music.  It is also good ""meditation music.""  Or music to use if someone is not feeling good, if not even listen to while laying down relaxing.  I was hoping to have the two songs when Daniel and his girl friend there were in it.  And when the song when they went to the dance.  I was expecting for those to be in it.",\
"Poetry Of The Negro is one of the best Poetry on Vinyl Records around.  Sidney Poitier's rendition of The Creation by James Weldon Johnson was absolutely Superb!!  Together Sidney Poitier and Doris Belack mastered the poetry in a way that made me, one who has not always understood it fall in love with it. This is a rare gem that I would definitely recommend.",B
This is a delightful story about Snoppy Cat owned by Marian Anderson.  The tale is a classic and little heard about.  Adults as well as children will be in awe of Ms. Anderson taking the time to capture her audience through spoken word reading.  She has left a timeless legacy for generations to come about the mischievous exploits and adventures of Snoopy Cat.  It is a real treasure.,A

Can't believe nobody reviewed this gem by Joan Baez. It was a favorite from early childhood. I scored a new RSD 2012 copy from an seller for about $12.00 + shipping on Amazon a few months ago. The remaster sounds really good but the vinyl is the thin 110 gram variety that warp easily so be warned. The songs are wonderful as is her young voice on this classic record that sounds much more natural than the bright CD.,\
I am so happy with my purchase. I got everything that was promised. They packaged it really well. Not a single thing was damaged. Definitely recommend.,C
I like all of them the photo book look so amazing and the case look so fabulous too and the pcs were awesome i totally luv it so much i enjoy Weny album alot,v
I like the album I got everything I got and totally luv the stickers it's so amazing Dang this is my first time seeing this album and I was so amazed by it,Y
Her music commentary is sharp and to the point from a British angle.  Picture Julia Child or Margaret Thatcher as a music history professor.,U
"I saw Herbie Mann perform live in the 1970's.  It was one of my first exposures to live jazz and I loved it.  This music reminds me of movie soundtracks from the early 60's.  The stronger, firmer Mann jazz didn't come until Memphis Underground and later explorations into Afro-Cuban sounds.  The sound is OK, but I feel like I'm waiting my turn in the dentist's office.",J
"whoah ... what a treat! I just got back my Speedy J CDs -- on loan to DJ Dragonfly -- an he plops this Saafi Bros CD on my player. An now it is stuck! In repeat. The CD has informed my hand that it isn't allowed to touch the eject button for a long time to come. Which is odd, given that there are a dozen new tasty treats awaiting their turn for a spin. What can I say?Well first, take equal parts Kruder, Dorfmeister, Maus on Mars & add a bit of Trent Reznor low rez bass-o-matic for spice (but not too much) you'll end up with much of the same sort of groove.The perfect companion to writing code.",h
Maybe the Best Compilation.,X

"Another great set of 66 songs from unknown bands, bringing you power pop. Good price for being exposed to all these bands. I would not say every one of the 66 songs is a keeper, but there are no stinkers in my opinion. Where are you going to find a 66 song compilation to give you 66 new bands to listen to?",Y
"Funny and brilliant! Sue Fink writes highly sophisticated, catchy songs with hilarious feminist lyrics. Check out her &#34;Boys Are Thugs&#34;, for example. (&#34;They're out to steal your candy, so they can buy more drugs…&#34;) Polished with quite a range of moods.",N
"This album including ""Oh-oh God, hear the cry of your people""  ""I'll praise you Your Name"" ""Songs of deliverance"" , ""Lord of the heavens"" etc are one of favorite all time songs since I first heard them in 1993",N

Bought this for my parents at their request as a gift - they absolutely love it!  They had me order them several more copies to give to friends and relatives as gifts.  I was very pleased that they are so happy with the music.  Would definitely order again from this vendor.,c
"Loved it. Big fan of her and her husband's podcast anyway. If these lips could talk is pure comedic brilliance. The cover doesn't hurt either. She is hot and funny, her husband must have been a saint in a previous life.",z
"I've been a fan of Incubus Succubus for some time.The music is spiritual and entertaining.  It speaks to the soul, and the heart.  Church of Madness was the song that made me a fan.  Call out my Name and Pagan born are two of the best.  The rest is a strong variety.",T

"I've known Wendy for over 20 years after first seeing her singing in NYC's Grand Central Station. She has the most beautiful, most crystal clear pristine voice I've ever heard. I own most of her CDs and this one (""Silky"") is one of my favorites. The track ""Go and Catch a Falling Star"" is especially haunting & beautiful. Every person for whom I've played her music has reacted the same way: ""Wow!!!""",u
Easily one of the greatest space rock albums I have ever heard.,v

We were first introduced to this CD in a dance class and are happy that we now own it.  The music is varied in style and tempo so that you don't get bored.  It lets your creativity flow.,K
"it's wonderful and loads of great songs on this cd, but the sound quality is not the best.  The sound is low so you'll need to raise up the volume.  Still I am glad I purchased it because there are some songs on here I could not find on other discs, such as &#34;I don't wanna hang up my rock n' roll shoes&#34;,  &#34;Caldonia&#34; and  &#34;Willie and the Hand Jive.&#34;",a
"This album is excellent from the first song to the last. If you enjoy the black crowes, then you will enjoy this album. The sound is awesome, and the lead singers voice is one-of-a-kind. Some songs tend to be raunchy in their subject matter, but the way the music is put together is awesome. I truely believe that if the Black Crowes had not exploded onto the music world in the way that they did, then this band very easily could have exploded in the same way. The sound is excellent.",v
The BEST Queen CD! Really encompasses their true musical and vocal talent!,B

Gotta love it! Sent it to my sister since we already listen to it most mornings. (3 of the songs on it at least!) Great orchestration as well as the vocals done by men who really know the ONE they are singing about!,]
This is one of Zakk Wilde's better projects. I like this earlier stuff more than his efforts with Black Label Society. More raw and emotional,p
Nice CD but I still think their first CD is better. They seem to reuse the same formula. I do like it but I was hoping for some real &#34;hit&#34; material,a
I thought it would be the songs of Maria Grever; instead it was a pianist playing the music with the lyrics!!!  It's not what I thought it would be and I returned it for a full refund.  That's what I like about Amazon...they are very fair with their customers.,P

"You might imagine my relief, punk rock not being my favorite genr&eacute;, that the songs on Ugly Cherries are clever, funny, gay, and the music & musicianship is very listenable and competent.  (Probably  in a few more listens i'll think they're excellent.) I had already liked their moxie.  I also like that they do raunchy drag: don't shave their body hair, don't have gym bunny bodies, don't give a fig what people think (oh yeah, that's moxie).I ordered this CD because of a scandal threatening to deep six the band. Recently i read the accused categorically denies the charges (which i'd figured were possibly bogus) and the duo are plowing ahead. Maybe they'll break through into the mainstream, or maybe they'll remain obscure with a loyal core of fans. I'd categorize their style on UC as punk folk rock, which is why i like it. Who knows what they could evolve into. To reiterate, these 2 guys do have considerable talent.",w
"I greatly admire Neil Young and have followed his career since almost its beginning. This CD contains little known songs of his, in concert. It seems he can do no wrong (artistically speaking). He's a good person, as well, and I have read his well written autobiography.

"Back in the late 50's and early 60's where the music on the 4 CD's hails from music-companies withthe emergence of 'vinyl 45's' realised that a whole new generation of potential customers were outthere including a large following from the fairer-sex who in the post-war era were becoming far morerelevant in the workplace therefore having spending powerThey realised that good-looks would sell records, it was a bonus if the emerging idol could also sing,this was to be the age of 'The Teen Idols'This release of course does have artists that had both appeal and sound vocal ability....I myself bought 45's released by all four featured artists though since the introduction of CD's have neverowned a 'Frankie Avalon' album...Till now that is.Disc One - Elvis...there is very little that hasn't already been said regarding 'The King'In little over 20 years he left a legacy that has long outlived his far too short life and will i'm sure prevailfor many many years to come.The tracks featured on disc-one include many of his late 50's and early 60's releases including several chart-toppers, along with one or two fondly remembered B-Sides, album tracks and indeed one or two songs thatmany remember from his movies -Disc 1 Elvis PresleyJailhouse Rock(Let Me Be) Your Teddy BearAll Shook UpBaby Let's Play HouseA Big Hunk O' LoveToo MuchLawdy Miss ClawdyBlue Suede ShoesDon't Be CruelHound DogThat's All RightMystery TrainRip It UpHard Headed WomanI Got StungHeartbreak HotelIt's Now Or NeverMy Wish Came TruePartyReturn To SenderStuck on YouSurrenderKing CreoleDon'tAre You Lonesome Tonight?She's Not YouWooden HeartFollow That DreamGood Luck CharmLove Me TenderFrankie Avalon was born in Philadelphia in 1940He started his show-biz career at an early age, but in terms of chart success broke onto the scene in the late50's first featuring in the U.K Chart in 1958 with Ginger Bread (reached '30') his next U.K success came thefollowing year with 'Venus' (Chart '16') though it actually topped in the States.Most of his recording success was indeed in America, however his number 'Why' did peak at number '20' inthe U.K and became his second U.S Chart-Topper.He was also known to turn his hand to acting playing a role in 'John Wayne's' - 'The Alamo' (which i own) aswell as several TV roles in America.The album enclosed includes all of his U.K hits along with many of his U.S Chart Entries -Disc 2 - Frankie AvalonVenusWhyDede DinahJust Ask Your HeartA Boy Without A GirlGinger BreadAll of EverythingYou Are MineDon't Throw Away Those TeardropsI'll Wait For YouTogethernessSwinging On a RainbowWhere Are YouA Perfect LoveBobby Sox To StockingsYou Excite MeThe Puppet SongDon't Let Love Pass Me ByTwo FoolsWhat Little GirlDianaHoneyJust Say I Love HerSecret LoveShe's Funny That WayTrouble With Me Is YouA MiracleTrue True LoveTuxedo JunktionWho Else But YouRicky Nelson was born Eric Hilliard Nelson in Teanek, New Jersey in 1940.Ricky also started his show-biz career at an early age featuring on both the radio and later T.V with his parents.As a solo-artist he broke into the charts here in the U.K in 1957 with 'Stood Up' (Chart '27') the following yearthe song 'Poor Little Fool' (Chart '4')(U.S. '1') was to signal quite a run of hits for him this side of the Atlanticmany of which are indeed featured on the disc on-board including 'It's Late' (Chart '3' 1959) - 'Hello Mary Lou'(Chart '2' 1961) and the same year 'Travelin' Man' (Chart UK '2')Ricky also had a turn on the acting front (which many a young pop-idol of the day seemed to do) he had a role(which i remember well as i have the film) in 'Rio Bravo' with 'John Wayne' and 'Dean Martin'Sadly 'Ricky' died quite young in 1985 when a victim of a plane-crash.Disc 3 -

'I Love You Baby' (Chart U.K '3' 1957) - 'You Are My Destiny' (Chart U.K '6' 1958) - 'LonelyBoy' (Chart U.K '3' 1959) and 'Put Your Head On My Shoulder' (Chart U.K '9' also 59') among the many.He recorded the first version of 'Puppy Love' back in 1960 which he also wrote, it peaked at '33' here in the U.K, itmade the number '2' slot in the States, many i'm sure will remember 'Donny Osmond's' 1972 version.His chart-success in America spanned a much longer period of time in America, here he had little success after 1962until his release of 'Your Having My Baby' in 1974 which reached number '6' in the U.K (Chart-Topper in America)The album on-board a great reflection of his Golden-Era...Disc 4 -

"For me, all these multi-artist Compilations are worthy of a glance, though unlikely if a collector you'll find any difficult-to-find recordings,what you will find is a collection of in the main Top-Ten-Hits from the early sixties in unfamiliar play-order which when listening to so manyfavourites from those times is always a pleasure.Back in the late fifties and early sixties competition for chart-supremacy was tough for' the U.K artists as there were indeed so many American-idols hogging the Top-Spots.Many U.K artists released cover versions of many of the Smash-Hits material the other side of the Atlantic (several examples of which can befound upon this 4-CD release.The collection offers a sample of hit-material on alternate CD's from both sides of the pond such as......'Brian Hyland' - 'Sealed With A Kiss'.......'Dion' - 'Runaround Sue'......'Brenda Lee' - 'Here Comes That Feeling' (saw little-miss Dynamite live back in the early 60's, quite a performer).....'Tommy Roe' - 'Sheila' (always felt he should have had more hits than he did)......and......'Chubby Checker' - 'The Twist' (always fell-over trying)......just some of the great sounds from the U.S to be found upon disc one......and on disc two......'Ricky Valance' - 'Tell Laura I Love Her' (thiswas one of the cover-versions of a U.S hit, 'Ricky' topped the U.K Chart with it)......'Eden Kane' - 'Well I Ask You'......'The Allisons' - Are You Sure'(came 2nd in the Eurovision-Song-Contest 1961)......'Brook Brothers' - 'Warpaint'......and......'Tommy Steele' - 'What A Mouth'......again just a sampleof the Brit-Artist Hits that can be found on disc two's track-listings......on disc three......'Ray Charles' - 'Hit The Road Jack'......'Duane Eddy' - 'DanceWith The Guitar Man' (always a favourite of mine)......'The Drifters' - 'Save The Last Dance For Me'......'Ketty Lester' - 'Love Letters'..... .and......'TheHighwaymen' - 'Michael' (many will remember Lonnie Donegan covering that one)......some of the many great sounds from the U.S that graced theU,K Charts to be found upon disc three.....disc four, back to U.K-Artists......'Adam Faith' - 'Poor Me'......'Marty Wilde' - 'Rubber Ball' (a cover of BobbyVee's smash-hit - both made the U.K Top Ten)......'Anthony Newley' - 'Do You Mind'......'Frank Ifield' - 'Lovesick Blues'......and......'Kenny Ball' -'Midnight In Moskow'......again just an example of the many great sounds that can be found on disc four........Glancing at the track listings i reckon i bought the vast majority on vinyl way back when....i have listed just a few of the many great memories thatCcan be found on each of the four discs to offer a feel of what's on-offer on this Collection.88 favourites from the 60's-era - gotta be worth checking out surely.TRACK-LISTINGS -Disc: 1  1.

"As is often the case the 'Now' music series continues to deliver collectable 'Theme' releases in addition to theirever popular year-on-year numbered offerings.There are many albums of this type out there to choose from, and as is often the case many tracks are repeatedtime and time again, for me, it's all about hearing so many favourites in a unfamiliar play-order.I did buy and review a 'Power-Ballad' album quite recently, and yes many of the tracks found on that one can befound on-board this release, however the selection overall does come up with many different numbers in additionto the 'Usual-Suspects' which, if you love these foot-stomping albums makes this 3-CD Compilation surely worth checking-out.I will simply highlight a few from each of the discs to offer a flavour of what can be found among the tracks on offer.On disc one........'Phil Collins' --'Against All Odds'........'Heart' --'Alone'........'Take That' --'Rule The World'........'Bonnie Tyler' --'Total Eclipse Of The Heart'.......,'Cutting Crew' --'I Just Died In Your Arms'........and........'Texas' --'I Don't Want A Lover'.......just some of the great sounds to be found among the 19 track play-list on disc one.......On Disc Two........'Coldplay' --'Yellow'........'Travis' --'Why Does It Always Rain On Me'........'Shania Twain' --'You'reStill The One'........'Miley Cyrus' --'Wrecking Ball'........'Starship' --'Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now'........and........'Michael Bolton' --'How Am I Supposed To Live Without You'........again a random selection of the memorable tracksfrom down the years that can be found among the 19 on disc two........On disc Three........'Survivor' --'Eye Of The Tiger'....'Alice Cooper' --'Poison'........'Tina Turner' --'The Best'........'Crowded House' --'Don't Dream It's Over'........'JeffBuckley' --'Hallelujah'........and........'Genesis' --'Mama'.............some of the 18 numbers to be enjoyed on disc three....I have simply highlighted around half a dozen tracks from each of the three discs to give an indication of the qualitythat can be found on-board, my selection was purely random there are obviously many more equally worthy of amention, for me, having so many great sounds from down the decades on one release is always worth checking out....",q
"When I started collecting CD's back in the 90's duplicating my Vinyl collection bit by bit was the target, obviously it,had to be done gradually, sometimes making choices carried one or two regrets, such as, why didn't I pick that upwhen I had the chance.One of these instances occurred with a Dave Clark Greatest Hits Album, had it in my hand, put it back because I'dalready picked up several to buy, thinking of course that I could pick it up another day, well, when I felt the urge todo so, couldn't find it, in the event it seemed to disappear of the scene, despite several searches couldn't find a 'DaveClarke' greatest hits CD , until this releases in 2008, obviously I didn't think twice.......again.The Group formed back in 1957 first calling themselves 'The Dave Clark Quintet' however after one or two line-upchanges the group changed their name to 'The Dave Clark Five' in 1962.The groups first hit was 'Do You Love Me' a number also covered by 'Brian Poole and the Tremeloes' which restrictedtheir Chart-Entry peaking at number '30' in late 63' however their next release 'Glad All Over' actually knocked the 'Beatles''I Want To Hold Your Hand' off the Top slot a little later the same year.Among some of the other U.K chart successes 'Bits And Pieces' (Chart '2' 1964) 'Can't You See That She's Mine' (Chart'10' 1964) and 'Catch Us If You Can' (Chart '5' 1965) they did achieve several lower-order Chart-Entries and had a resurgenceof their fortunes a few years after their last Top 10 success with songs like 'Everybody Knows' (Chart '2' 1967) 'Red Balloon'(Chart '7' 1968) 'Red Balloon' not on-board this release......'Good Old Rock'n'Roll' (Chart '7' 1969) and 'Everybody Get Together'(Chart '8' 1970)The Group proved very popular in the U.S in truth having greater success than here in the U.K...........the group disbanded 1970.This album contains most of the groups best known tracks along with one or two I remember as 'B-Sides'Inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2008",L

"In February 1968, the Metropolitan Opera presented Verdi's LUISA MILLER for the first time since 1930, with a principal cast that included Met veteran Richard Tucker and relative Met newcomers Montserrat Caballe and Sherrill Milnes.  One performance of the run (the matinee broadcast?)  was preserved on CD.  While Tucker was in good voice for his age at the time (50), the youthful, musical, and affecting singing of Caballe and (especially) Milnes make this recording a keeper; Milnes absolutely shines here.  Giorgio Tozzi and Ezio Flagello as the villains are as good as they were on the complete, studio LUISA of 1964, with Anna Moffo in the title role.  The remastered, &#34;live&#34; sound is astonishingly vivid. If not a first-choice LUISA (it has cuts), this set is a must-have for fans of Caballe, Tucker, and/or Milnes.",w
"[[ASIN:B01K8ML9G8 Sherrill Milnes in Recital, Vol.1 [IMPORT] by Sherrill Milnes (1997-01-29)]]  In the best tradition of American operatic baritones, Sherrill Milnes had a voice that was rich, resonant, round, and robust, with a smooth legato, ringing high notes, and a lovely mezza voce.  In the 1980's that voice -- in its prime during the 1960's and 1970's -- experienced gradual decline due to a vocal-chord injury Milnes sustained in 1981.  KINGDOM BY THE SEA presents the best of Milnes' recital singing recorded between 1980 and 1990.  Few of the tracks on the disc show evidence of serious vocal decline, and even those that do also suggest that Milnes' artistry never diminished during his later years.Posa's death scene from DON CARLO and the Champagne Aria from DON GIOVANNI are the only selections from Milnes' operatic repertoire on the CD; the remainder is comprised of rarer opera arias (e.g. Gretry's &#34;O Richard&#34; from RICHARD, COEUR DE LION) and the German, English, and American songs that Milnes so loved.  The Gretry aria sounds almost as though it could have been written for Milnes, so well does it suit his voice; the same might be said of the Gerald Finzi songs and Loehr's charmingly funny &#34;The Little Irish Girl,&#34; which draws laughter from the (Carnegie Hall?) audience.  The most magical track of all, however, is #19:  a song called &#34;Duna&#34; by Josephine McGill.  Recorded in 1980, it shows Milnes' voice -- and particularly his mezza voce -- at its most hauntingly beautiful, his talent for communication at its very best.  Milnes' friend and accompanist, the late Jon Spong, provides adept piano support in every track.  If you are a fan of Sherrill Milnes, then you need to have both KINGDOM BY THE SEA and its &#34;companion&#34; disc, THERE BUT FOR YOU GO I, in your collection.",V
"[[ASIN:B01K8MWNP4 Sherrill Milnes in Recital, Vol.2 [IMPORT] (1997-10-02)]]  This CD is a compilation of some of Sherrill Milnes' best recital work from the years 1980 to 1990.  The American baritone, in his prime in the 1960's and 1970's, had a vocal-chord issue in 1981 (when he was forty-six) that led to a relatively early vocal decline.  However, only tracks #3 and #18 really reflect this decline; and those tracks both show, if not the most beautiful tone, then the superb legato that always was a hallmark of Milnes' style.&#34;Nemico della patria&#34; from ANDREA CHENIER is the only operatic aria on the disc, the remainder being comprised mostly of French art songs and Milnes' beloved oratorio repertoire; the comically Handelian song &#34;Old Mother Hubbard,&#34; written by Victor Hely Hutchinson in the twentieth century, is also present.  Though the two Baroque oratorio selections that open the disc find Milnes in wonderful voice (these were recorded in 1980), the clear highlight of the CD is the set of four Serious Songs by Johannes Brahms.  Captured in 1984 or 1985, they show Milnes at his peak:  serious vocal decline had not yet set in, and his artistry was fully mature.  Most impressive is the fourth of the songs, &#34;Wenn ich mitt Menschen,&#34; which sounds almost as though it could have been written expressly for Milnes' voice.  But to hear a side of Milnes that was not frequently apparent in opera, go to track #19, &#34;Old Mother Hubbard,&#34; and delight in the droll (and agile!) performance that draws laughter from the enthusiastic, Carnegie Hall audience.Milnes' friend and regular accompanist, Jon Spong, provides adept piano support in all of the tracks.  THERE BUT FOR YOU GO I is a valuable document of the non-operatic, later-career Sherrill Milnes.  If you are a fan of his, then you need this CD.",m
"I originally got this CD free from Tilex.  I used it in my dance classes for cool down exercises.  Some students said it was their favorite part of the class.  Then I became careless, carrying it loose in my bags, and it broke.  Because the package gives no names of artists or composers, I did not know how/where to find a replacement.  I was delighted to locate it through Google to Amazon, and once again my dance students are enjoying moving to this exceptionally beautiful, restful music.  I recommend it to anyone seeking a serene musical interlude.",W

"La fea más bella (The Most Beautiful Ugly Girl – 590 minutes)We are talking about an uncommonly unattractive young woman who is uncommonly smart. Lety (Angélica Vale) keeps trying to get a job but is consistently bumped by buxom blondes. Our gal has braces on her teeth, bad hair, a unibrow, a terrible fashion sense, ugly glasses and poor posture.Through a fluke that discloses how bright she is, she gets a job at an ad agency but is stuck in a back room so clients won't see her. With her post-graduate degrees and excellent education, our homely heroine quickly becomes indispensable. The two most handsome men (Juan Soler and Jaime Camil) fall for her because she is so different. She ends up owning the company and loving both men; she just can't make up her mind.The most consistent comic relief is an odd couple that consists of a brainy but homely man (Luis Manuel Ávila) and a very, very buxom blonde (Patricia Navidad). We also enjoy the world's worst spy. His cell phone goes off regularly.... This is laugh-out-loud funny at times but is a bit too cartoony. Which I can forgive because it really IS fun.",n

"This is by far the best of their albums, not to slight the first two. They were great also but this one drives. I'm almost exhausted when I finish listening to it. I saw them live in the 60's at an anusment park in Oklahoma City. They were opening for Mitch Ryder They got so many encores that Mitch finally came out himself and said no more, It was time for him to play. Needless to say Mitch was second fiddle that night. They were doing a lot of soul and Motown style music, I suppose because they were touring with Mitch. One of the songs that blew everyone away was &#34;Reach Out (I'll Be There)&#34; Which they performed better than the Four Tops could ever hope to do. The absolute best unknown band I've ever seen. They were actually better that most known bands. Wish there was more nusic available from them.",[

I have read the book at least six times in the 25 plus years I have owned it.

"Wow! Finally a Western made for the adult mind! Thank you Hollywood for a job well-done!What a delightfully complex film about motivation, relationships and values. It's about a father and a  son on the verge of manhood, and another son with an illness;  a bad guy who has a strong sense of self and truly knows how to lead;  about a society that condones the mass murder of women and children as long as they are Native Americans but not of armed robbers stealing from what was then one of the most powerful corporations on earth - the railroad  industry.It's also about a society which tolerates racism towards hardworking Chinese laborers building the railroads; and at the same time allows working-class, Caucasian  farmers to be brutally pushed off  their land in order to make the powerful even richer. But the only real ""bad"" guy society is organized against is the one who steals from the rich and powerful! How incredibly convenient and ironic!This story is also about pride, self-respect, intelligence, courage and even self-confidence. We are also confronted with senseless violence committed by evil men on one hand and the  immediate need for self-defense on the other. What's worth risking your life over? Is the central question 3:10 to Yuma asks.There's so much going on this amazing film, there's no way to absorb it all the first time around! What a breath of fresh air to watch such a clever story!",a

"This package included a number of classic albums that I didn't already have.  For me, it was a good deal even though I owned a number of the albums included.  Please note that many of Emmylou's CD's are re-mastered with additional tracks. The same album if included in this package will feature the original song list, without the additional tracks, and (I'm not sure) probably not re-mastered.  I'm still pleased to have bought this compilation, but wish that this would have been made clear in the Amazon product description.  As to Emmy Lou and the content here, there aren't enough stars to give her.",g

"If you are interested in music of the Codex Calixtinus or of the Camino de Santiago more broadly, you should consider this album. The content is one of the masses contained in Book I of the Codex and it is superbly produced. Among other elements, the production places the singers in positions (relative to the microphones) that would have been used in the actual mass, resulting in the sensation of being there.",Z
"CD was delivered Unscratched.  I've been looking for the CD version of LIA for years and finally found it.  The music is just like I remembered it, southing.",l
"The fact is, too many people can't accept when a band grows in another direction so this album and the great songs on it is not the issue, the real issue is the fans who live in a little box from the 80's. Did they really expect Cherry Pie in 1996?Jani Lane grew as a songwriter and this album shows that and it's excellent.And if you are stuck on the 80's, listen to ""Letter to a Friend"" on repeat, it's classic (and awesome) Jani Lane songwriting. AYM is slamming as are many of the tracks after a few listens.And Jani still has one of the best voices on earth so there's that too.",r
Expanding Nat's collection,n
Great album,C
good music,p
Best pre mix cleaner you can buy. Highly recommend for a reason. Make small batches and store in brown containers out of light. The growler bottles I never refill are perfect for storage. I use an okki Nokki. I don’t notice any sonic difference if I rinse after suction.,g
Awesome,X

"I'll update this review after I have time to listen to this album, which I assume I'll at very least like, so 4 stars for now. I want to note immediately that the tracks on the album I received (Arista -- catalog #ABM 2008) are not the same as those listed in the review by Joe. Here is the track listing for mine (updated 12/11/14 because the tracks actually on the album are ordered differently than as listed on album jacket):Side 11. Drivin' Wheel2. Lord I Felt3. It Don't Matter Now4. When I'm Home5. I Think I Love You Again6. MelodicSide 21. Midnight Rider2. Billy3. Dear Me4. Where Men Don't Care5. A Good Old Time Love Song",c
"This is my favorite of her collections. I have been looking for it for years as once I had the cassette form of this treasure. I kept the cover of it that came inside the cassette till I could find it again in CD form and discovered Amazon. Expensive &#34;FOR SURE&#34; but well worth it if you love her stuff. The main reason is that it contains her classics and other songs you may have not heard form her but will fall in love with once you hear them, because they are preformed live and in ENGLISH as well as French. Again a TREASURE!!!",N

"***** BEWARE as this Thin Lizzy CD may be subject to DISC ROT ( aka CD rot) ******As a long time Thin Lizzy fan, I have had this CD in my collection for years. I pulled it out to listen to it recently and found it to sound rather odd. The sound would go in and out and sound muffled. I thought it was my CD player but then found this to be the case on any CD player I used. On CDs, the rot becomes visually noticeable in two ways:(a) When the CD is held up to a strong light, light shines through several pin-prick-sized holes.(b) Discoloration of the disc, which looks like a coffee stain on the disc. See also CD bronzing.Mine has the pin holes - see attached pictures. One is a picture of the disc looking fine but when one holds a mag light up to the Cd, you see the pin holes!In audio CDs, the rot leads to scrambled or skipped audio or even the inability to play a track. This is the case for my CD making it a waste of money. I have come to the conclusion that this is due to the manufacturer, Windsong. I saw a similar thing with some Crowded House CD singles in which the digipack caused the CD to rot and become discolored and unreadable.I am NOT saying those for sale here are bad CDs but I would be fearful to spend good money with no guarantees. All of my other CDs are fine so this is the one case where it can only be attributed to the manufacturer.",B

"This hour-long, 16-track compilation selects the highlights from Wire Train's three Columbia albums (but not its two MCA albums) along with a few rarities.COLLECTORS TAKE NOTICE: Amazingly, early copies mistakenly substituted the B-side &#34;Half A Lifetime&#34; for &#34;The Last Perfect Thing&#34; (track #6). Ultimately, the mistake was corrected but meanwhile an interesting collector's item was created and surprisingly hard to find. Obviously, if you were lucky enough to get one of the first 500-1000 copies, you have this &#34;mistake&#34;. The bonus is that &#34;Half A Lifetime&#34; is a great song and unavailable for digital download anywhere!!!ALL Music BIO:Wire Train was formed as the Renegades in April 1983 in San Francisco by San Francisco State University students and guitarists Kevin Hunter and Kurt Herr with the rhythm section of Anders Rundblad (bass) and Frederico Gil-Sola (drums). The group signed to the local 415 label, also home to acts like Romeo Void and Translator, all of which found themselves with national distribution when 415 entered into a deal with Columbia Records. Wire Train's first album, ...In a Chamber, made the national charts in 1984, but the group began to suffer personnel changes. Gil-Sola was replaced by Brian Macleod for the second album, Between Two Words, after which Herr left, to be replaced by Jeffrey Trott. A third album, Ten Women, charted in 1987. The group's last two albums, Wire Train (1990) and No Soul No Strain (1992), appeared on MCA",H

"Where does one start? The latest release from the Willie Hines Band covers a tremendous amount of territory. If you want pop sensibility, you get it in songs like ""Say Hello"", ""Hippie Chick"", and ""Downtown"". If you want a straight ahead rock tune, then ""Boyd's Party"" is definitely in the sweet spot along with ""Solitare"" not far behind. If you want circa Led Zep sound, then ""The Drift"" is right there with big time nods to the mighty Plant/Page machine. If you want power-pop-rock, then ""Smile"" is the song that will get you singing the chorus immediately and wanting more! There is not a dull moment of sound on this album.Much has changed musically since Willie Hines was singing for The Lights and Jet Red but one thing remains constant- Willie Hines continues to bring finely crafted music to those who are willing to find it. With the input of Jeffery Babineau (guitar, backing vocals, and much more!), John Wise (bass, keys, backing vocals), and Michael ""Fro"" Frowein (drums, backing vocals, the album sparkles with talented musicianship. Will this album make the charts? Not likely due to the state of the fractured music industry today where great talent is overlooked while posers somehow get a seat in the spotlight. Nonetheless, if you are a fan of real music being made by real people, then this album is for you. It has so much to offer to so many people that it just might actually gain some new followers for the WHB. Don't miss out and get it today and continue to support your local music scene! Rock on!!Track listing:Say HelloSolitareDowntownThe DriftHoneymoon JunkieGreta GarboEverybody ElseSmileGypsy's GiftHippie ChickBoyd's PartyGoodbyeMy picks are ""Smile"", ""Boyd's Party"", and ""Solitare"" but then again, I just like good music from good people.............",u

Bobby Field and webb are longtime collaborators). The versions are a tad different than the one's we know and love from Webb Wilder. Are they better or worse? Hard to say. I love ""Twangeaux"" as it is an instrumental ala WW fine works like ""Horror Hayride"" and the ""Goldfinger"" cover. ""Powerful Stuff"" is the old Fab T-Birds tune that made it into the movie Cocktail. ""Calling Dr. Strong"" is an interesting song in which the Ionizer uses an electronic sort of voice. This song really rocks. Many of the songs are very mellow yet show off The Ionizer's strong songwriting skills. This one-off record is a must for any self-respecting Webb Wilder fan!",a

"GREAT!! Walter Wray was the lead singer for King Swamp. When the Swamp fell apart due to lack of label support, he moved to a solo career. This album was made with former band mate Dominic Miller. Sound familiar? Yes, the same Dominic Miller who plays guitar for Sting! The music is stunning and is a natural evolution from the Swamp.Nice melodies and wonderful lyrics make this a nice find for the Swamp fan looking for the never made third album. Of course, a quick search on line will find KING SWAMP and then a further follow up via that site will connect you to more rare Walter and King Swamp music but you need to do that.....If you can get this album, you should. Walter has re-started his musical career in the UK and is active on his my space page. In fact, he has this album available via Amazon UK autographed!!!",U

"In 1997, Tony Blair wins the peoples' vote to become Prime Minister. The Queen doesn't like this; apparently he is a modernist. However, she must follow proper protocol and ask him if he'll be prime minister. He says yes,  he and his wife back out of the room (never show your back to the queen), and then Princess Diana dies.She and Prince Philip don't think it's any big deal, but Prince Charles actually has a tear in his eye, and raves about what a great mother she was. This makes the Queen feel as though he's putting down her mothering skills. Anyway, as we all remember, the public went crazy with grief, and expected the royals to share in it. But they didn't, and that's what this whole film is about, which makes it super boring.Advisors are afoot everywhere, and Tony Blair finally talks the queen into coming back to London from her 40,000 estate in Balmoral. She happens to see a 14 point stag that her husband and grandkids have been stalking to get their minds off the death of their mother. Seeing the free and beautiful stag means something to her and she begins to cry (with her back to the camera). What does the stag mean? Does it represent Diana stalked by photographers, which some believe lead to her death? Or does the stag represent Diana as she was when married to Charles - stalked by the royal family trying to get her to change, never show her feelings, and put up with Charles having a mistress? OR, does the stag represent the Queen herself, roped into the monarchy due to her father's death, and feeling it's ""God's will"" that she is royalty, and must represent her people? Which she does by being filthy rich, being waited on hand and foot, and having 40,000 acre estates. The queen finds out later, that the stag was killed, having ""wandered"" off the 40,000 acres to another estate, where a paying guest wounded him, then a servant had to finish  him off. She makes a visit the stag's decapitated body, however, it doesn't show her going to pay her respects to Di. Is the stag a substitute?What upsets the queen so much, is she can't believe that her people are making SUCH a fuss about Di's death, and that now 1 out of 4 have voted to abolish the monarchy. She feels as though she has given her life to these peasants, going around shaking hands with the poor, and they don't even appreciate it.  The queen believes that Great Britain was widely respected for its decorum in the face of tragedy, and that showing your emotions is simply not done.However, to prevent an uprising and perhaps losing her castle, she bitterly and against her better judgment gives in to Tony Blair's (who has gone to the other side and become her champion)advice, goes back to London, looks at some flowers that mourners have placed there, and takes very personally the hand-lettered notes (""your blood is on their hands""). Bummer.Well, it was all a very unpleasant affair, but now the Queen can go on about her business, without having to worry about Di causing any more headlines.",x
"This is an album that's usually part of an audiophile's collection because it was recorded well.  I like Dire Straits but not a diehard fan so I like about half of the songs here, but I end up playing the entire album just because it sounds so good!  If you're not a big fan you might lose interest after the hits play - ""So Far Away"", ""Money for Nothing"" and ""Walk of Life"".",T
Rockin' Out !!!,o
Completes Collection.,t
AWESOME !!!,h
Excellent book on how the body heals itself.  Easy to read on modern day discoveries of the cell,z
"The Cover Art of the Real Fanderson Version of the Space: 1999 Year Two CD is NOT pictured here.  The genuine Fanderson - Space: 1999 Year Two cover art is completely different than the crap shown here.  The real Fanderson version of Space: 1999 Year Two CD has the following on its back.  The CD information states... This album has been digitally remastered from the best possible analog source material.  Every effort has been made to minimize noise and distortion inherent in the original recordings.The Fanderson Space: 1999 Year Two collection that contain more original tracks contains TWO CD's.  The cover art for the real Fanderson Space: 1999 2 CD set has the fanderson logo on the CD's back cover.  The front cover art shows a rather expansive view of Moonbase Alpha looking from the outermost base and buildings toward the Main Mission \ Command Center hub.  Slightly to the right of the Command Center hub in the sky above Moonbase Alpha is a green nebula.  Closer in are two reddish orange planets one larger - closer the other smaller further away.  the Space: 1999 logo is emblassoned in yellow between Moonbase Alpha and the green nebula.  In a purple border above the cover art picture is printed in white, ORIGINAL TELEVISION SOUNDTRACK.  On a lower purple border is printed in white YEAR TWO.In the lid cover assembly can be seen the words... THE WORLDS OF GERRY ANDERSON.  There are numerous elements and artifacts that mark the legitimate version of the Space: 1999 Year 2 CD set from imposters.  Most obvious the real Fanderson Space: 1999 Year 2 collection includes 2 CD's not one.  The real Space: 1999 Year 2 collection includes a full color booklet showing scenes and background from select Space: 1999 episodes that relate to the music content offered on each of two CD's.  The booklet is the highest possible image quality using glossy paper.  The images are crisp and clear.  Each of the two Space: 1999 Year 2 CD's is covered on one side by a full picture of the moon.  On top of the lunar picture is the Space: 1999 logo in bright yellow.  Underneath the CD's Bright yellow Space: 1999 logo is a reflective void in the CD spelling out YEAR TWO with a number 1 inside a circle near the bottom edge of CD1.  Likewise for CD 2 of the set except the Circle on the lower most edge of CD 2 in this set has a reflective number 2 in a circle.  These pictures of the Moon are NOT labels that can be pealed off.  The Whitish gray moon pictures are heat bonded to the surface of the CD in a process that makes them effectively impossible to remove without damaging the respective CD's.  Finally the best identifying quality of the 2 CD Space: 1999 Year 2 version is the art of the back cover.  On the best quality 2 CD Space: 1999 Year Two CD set there is a picture of an Eagle Transporter hovering just above the lunar surface near one of the Nuclear Waste Domes with tanks in the foreground.  The  Disk One and Two music list and times are also viable.  The Fanderson logo is in the lower right hand corner.  If you see all these things you likely have a good 2 disk Space: 1999 Year 2 TV Series Soundtrack if not blast outta there at full thrusters and use booster units if available.In the 2 CD Set Space: 1999 Year 2 collection ""The Taybor"" is well represented and very nicely done comprising a full 19.15 minutes of CD number 2.  This is an awesome CD set if you want the entire suite of soundtrack music from Space: 1999 Year 2.  I consider this 2 disk Space: 1999 CD set one of the crown jewels of my Space: 1999 collection and were what was on offer here the real thing it would be a steal at $399.00.  I paid almost $200.00 for my 2 CD Fanderson authentic Space: 1999 Year Two set and wondered at the time was I foolish to pay so much.  I must say any doubts I used to have about having paid too much for my rare 2 CD, Space: 1999 Year 2 set are long gone.  It is rare if ever that I see the genuine Two disk Fanderson Space: 1999 Year Two set on offer anywhere.  I hunt auctions for others who would love their own authorized two CD disk Fanderson Space: 1999 Year 2 set and I found another set once 7 years ago.I write this review as a warning to good people.  There are LOTS of fake offerings out there that suggest they contain the entire expanded genuine Year 2 TV soundtracks.  The real Fanderson expanded editions contain tracks never heard on the actual Space: 1999 Year 2 series.  I just don't want good Amazon.com customers getting burned by people saying they have the real two disk Space: 1999 Year 2 set when at best all they offer is a cheap substandard often incomplete imitation.  The over $300 dollars being asked is a lot of money to part with to end up disappointed and maybe even cheated.  The quality of the genuine Fanderson Remastered Space: 1999 Year 2 CD's is nothing short of excellent.  Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware!) Good people do not let yourselves be ripped off.If this CD was the real thing it would be a steal but given it is not its Dreck. (Garbage!)  I write this review because; shopping on Amazon.com is made better for everyone when we all share insights and information that helps fellow shoppers make more informed buying decisions while avoiding pitfalls.  I love Space: 1999 and I don't want it getting a tarnished reputation due to lame or bootleg products.",O
This sounds like it was recorded on a cheap cassette Walkman in someone's pocket. It is not a legit live recording. I loved this concert when I saw it but I cannot listen to this. Complete waste!,u
My grandparents had been looking for a certain song from Hank Williams and it was on this set. They absolutely love it!,d
Forever Changes is  of the best albums from the 1960's. This is one of the few Sgt. Pepper concept type albums that works. A truly overlooked masterpiece.,E
I still like to hear Hank enjoy this very much,e
"I can't believe they only have two tracks on this CD!!!  And the second one is loaded with cursing and can't be played in mature adults presence, or very young.",`
"I have really enjoyed this album of great, relaxing music.  Can't recommend it highly enough.  But then, I'm just a guy.",S
"Excellent sound quality.  What distinguishes this show from Live Dates I and II, and the Live In Tokyo show, is that Powell and Turner were here experimenting with pedal effects (talkbox and wah) in a prominent way, rather than playing their normal clean Allman Bros.-like lines.  It's a good show but the effect songs (3) just don't come off that well, particularly the talkbox in Jailbait, which at times  when used as rhythm sounds like static or feedback distortion.  Still, there some really enjoyable performances here.",a
Why on earth would this Cd Single be so hard to find. Some parts have been added to compilations adding only 1 minute or 2 minutes of the song. Not enought to enjoy the pleasure of the song. A song that is so full of inspiration. It makes you wanto getup and dance...it shines a light where there is darkness. Do we need to pray to find this CD ? Maybe. This tune diserves more than just a moment in time.,j
Excellent CD of religious songs.,q
This is an excellent CD of religious tunes.  It is not an album of traditional gospel music but rather more modern songs of faith.  David Patillo has a great voice and is a very good singer.  Most of the songs on the CD were written by him.  The selection and balance of songs makes it a very pleasing CD to listen to.  I highly recommend it.,t

"Thanks!!, but not what I expected.",M
I feel like I know these songs from a past life. Wonderful music that really hits a spot no other band has ever hit.,c
I was excited when the band reformed and started recording again. Smashing pumpkins is known for there unique style of rock. It’s what made them what they are. This album throws out everything they’ve built and flushed it down the toilet. Creating a experience that is bland and down right boring. No rock what’s so ever. Nothing here but a Billy corgan solo album. Which was far far from the rock alternative sound into synth sounding album that’s not worth the time or the money. Nothing memorable. Truly awful album.,z
"This album was like having the Abba and Jesus speak over me thru the Holy Spirit, who I am in Him and who He is and His heart for me. Meeting me in the depths of my struggle. The lyrics to every song touch my heart and the music takes it to a place of soaking and praising. At least that was my experience. Very thankful for this album. It was a Godsend for me!",D
Steffany is one of my all time favorite praise singers. Her music is packed with truth and heart and talent. Such a pleasure to listen to these tracks. It often takes right into Abba’s embrace.,K
Heard the re-done tracks and said &#34;hey that's not bad&#34;.  Heard the originals and said &#34;there's the Michael Jackson I'm looking for&#34;. The originals have a vintage Michael Jackson feel to it and I like that vibe.  I ended up buying only the individual original tracks only and paid less than $12.00 on the Amazon app.,E
"One of her last recordings (2005) before retiring to Canada, when it comes to female guitarists, Ellen Mcilwaine is legendary. The sound is crisp. recorded live at Japan's Yellow. Backed by bass & drums, Ellen chooses to go the electric route on this offering. Includes a 17 minute funky 70's medley. If you can find a copy of this, enjoy!",R
"I have been unhappy with the 'Motown Greatest Hits' Series. I found their sound quality to be muddy, distorted, or in mono. Volume 1 of this 'Promo Only' EMI Box Set, had superb sound, with most tracks being in their original stereo mixes. Volume 2 here, has quite a few more tracks in mono, but once again, the stereo tracks are the best I have heard. If you love Motown, but are picky about sound quality, these box sets are a worthwhile investment.",p
"I have always been disappointed with the Motown Greatest Hits Series. Most of the selections sound 'muddy' or distorted, or in mono. The tracks here in this 'Promo' 4 CD Box Set from EMI Publishing, has the most pristine sounding Motown I have heard to date. In Stereo! There is a Volume 2, so I just ordered that. Highly recommended, if you are fussy about sound quality.",v
"After seeing and hearing Tyler in the documentary, 'ROCK PROPHECIES', I am thinking to myself, this kid could be the hope, for the future of the blues.So much for that idea, after hearing these tunes.Thank God we got Bonamassa.I wish Tyler all the best, as this is obviously the path he wants to pursue.But, I still think, he should be down in Chicago, kickin' butt with Buddy Guy...",p

"Excerpts from Dylan's iconic mid-1970s Rolling Thunder Revue, featuring live performances of &#34;Shelter from the Storm,&#34; and a 10-minute blistering version of &#34;Idiot Wind.&#34;  Much of this material is also available on &#34;Hard Rain,&#34; another live CD from the iconic tour. Dylan -- in a burnoose -- is throaty and hard-charging. The sound mixing was widely criticized on these recordings, and you'll hear why.",M
I have loved Brook Benton's music for a long time and I look forward to hearing more of it.,F
I bought as a gift and she loves it.  Nice selection of songs.,b

"Wow.First off, the writing is incredible. Next, the story is better than good. This is not a formula novel. I think that anyone could read (or listen) to this and connect with the main character on some level. If you've been up in the world; if you've been lonely or feeling empty; if you have loved; if you have hurt people - it's all there. I almost felt like the narrator was telling the story that a lot of us would tell some part of if we were honest enough. This is one you will want to go back to again and again. I listened to the audiobook, but am going to be getting the hardback (for my bookshelf) *and* a paperback (to read and re-read).It will do no good to tell you anything else about this book because it's one that will mean something different to each individual reader.",s
"I own this CD and have played it for many of my friends who are Veterans from Vietnam, Desert Storm, OEF, and OIF.  The response I get is ""Where can I buy this?"".  I've even been told one Vet wants the song played at his funeral.  It is a very moving song.  Well worth the money for a single song!",u
"I purchased this because I really enjoy Simon and Garfunkel and I wanted to hear what they sounded like before they became famous.  The music on this CD is more 50's light rock than folk. If I had not been listening to a CD by Simon and Garfunkel I would not have recognized either of them in many of the songs. I did hear elements of what they were to become in a few of the songs and that was nice.The Songs on this CD are from 1957 to 1960.The song list is as follows:1. Dream Alone2. Beat Love3. Just A Boy4. Play Me A Sad Song5. It Means A Lot To Them6. Flame7. Shy8. The Lone Teen Ranger9. Hey School Girl10. Our Song11. Teenage Fool12. Dancin' Wild13. Don't Say Goodbye14. Two Teenagers15. True Or False16. Just To Be With You17. Dreams Can Come True18. Pretty WordsThe CD does not come with any extras explaining when or where the songs were recorded. It would have been nice to have a paragraph or two talking about the early years of Simon and Garfunkel.This music is nothing like the Simon and Garfunkel of the 60's.  Still, if you are a Simon and Garfunkel fan it might be worth hearing what they sounded like before they matured and developed into the greats that they became and still are. Overall I am glad I purchased this.",e
"We love all of Tim Janis' music, but this one is a new favorite because of our Irish-Scottish heritage. Truly beautiful, relaxing & with a libation, it will carry you away to the beautiful British Isles.",E

We heard this artist on Sirius Radio and decided to try something by him. We really enjoy the cd and are glad to support the artist.,a
"This import from the UK is a must own for anyone who loves the old train songs.  The collection is a crazy bargain, 200 somngs for just $20.  The collection includes legends like Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash & Hank Williams right along side the obscure like Hawkshaw Hawkins, Timy Bradshaw & Lonnie Glosson.",]
"The March Violets are probably best known from the Some Kind Of Wonderful soundtrack.  This 1985 release is a decent collection of 80's English goth rock with ""Walk Into The Sun"" and ""Eldorado"" standing out as the best tracks.",y
"Franke & The Knockouts achieved a top ten single in 1981 with the infectious ""Sweetheart"".  Hailing from the New Brunswick, NJ club scene, their music styling is rock but with an ear towards the pop side. ""Sweetheart"" is the catchiest and best song they released, but other solid efforts include ""Without You"" and ""You're My Girl"".",R
Great music.,D
It doesn't sound as good as the original mp3s I got off the old real radio web board it does have cleaned up audio,a

Heard several of these in person while at youth camp in Colorado. I was reading my scriptures and the word bridegroom appeared which reminded me of a song in this CD. I'm in my 30s now and wondered if I could find the CD again. Hadn't crossed my mind in years. I was surprised when the singers name popped into my head. I wasn't even sure I had it right. Wish I had $20 to buy it again.,n
Great music from one of the greats. If you like Chet Baker this is a must-have.,c
"Good value, Some great songs",`
"I've loved Morgana's singing ever since I heard her, sometime in the early 60's.  Two of my all time favorite tunes of hers are &#34;Bluesette&#34; and &#34;All Blues.&#34;  Bluesette was &#34;supposed&#34; to be on her CD &#34;With a Taste of Honey,&#34; but wasn't. After some research, I found out that my two favorite (but missing) tunes were on an identical CD but with slightly different printing on the CD cover. So, I had to pay for a new CD which did have those two extra tunes I so much wanted. Why they did that, I have no idea.",m
"Very nice recording with just a few exceptions. The level of the live cannons used seems to be set way too high! Now, I know what cannons (and artillery) sound like but WOW, even the grill cloth on my speakers vibrate outward about an inch or so and that's just using medium volume. I would play that particular passage at lower than normal volume to be certain you don't blow a woofer on this CD. Aside from that, I love the arrangement and sound of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra.",n
This record arrived shattered... so who knows if its any good.  I do know that this sell does not know how to package or ship !!!,`

I bought this in the form of a cassette tape about 40 years ago! It has been without a doubt the most inspirational album that I have ever owned. I wonder if Judy is still with us? She has no idea what a blessing this album has been to so many. It's a wonderful musical attribute to the Pilgrim's Progress!,b
It took a little bit to come cause it comes from korea. It's really good even tho it's only 4 songs but it's a mini album .. very happy with it,x

"I heard them in So California in the 1950's live at a Sing-Spiration.  The lead singer's wife played piano for them.  My family, and some of our church members went to hear them back then, and we bought an album when the concert was over.  I have listened and loved each song all these years!  Reign Master Jesus Reign is maybe my favorite, but they are all great.  I made an amature copy from my vinyl album to a CD-writable, and you can hear all the pops and scratches on it, but that's okay!  I wish it could be done professionally and released to modern day fans!",G
Exactly as described and perfect at a great price. It is always a pleasure shopping on Amazon.com! Thank you kindly.,_
"Nat King Cole, what a wonderful singer and this album is great for fans like I am of him.",y
The best word to describe this is JUNK.  There are all kinds of technical problems.  It is in the shop all the time.  Zero help from the manufacturer.  They do not respond to my requests for help.,Z

"This lesser known and still wonderful Donizetti opera tells the story of a young woman Marie who was abandoned as a baby in the Tyrolese mountains and reared by a regiment of French Grenadier soldiers. She falls in love with a young man and finds her long-lost mother Marquise de Birkenfeld who bore Marie out of wedlock. Marie is pressured into an arranged marriage, but seeing her despair the Marquise finally relents thus allowing her to marry her true love. The performance displays an incredibly talented and vocally perfect Anna Moffo. This is live recording from 12/60 and the sound quality is very good++ - much better than most live recordings from this period. It's a wonderful chance to hear the great Moffo early in her career. Plus, opening your ears to a beautiful and touching opera by Donizetti. The only complaint that I have is this cd is highlights only. It would be terrific if only they would release the entire opera considering the sound quality being so good.",Y
"As far as the music for this set, it's great!  Packaging appears to have mixed up the CDs with the 3 disc set.  I received my order as requested, 2 CD Version, however, instead of the remastered original album (Disc 1), I received disc 3 - The Homecoming Concert.  Disc 2 (More Money Maker) was appropriately included. Perhaps this is a problem with having so many alternate sets to satisfy everyone's pocketbook.  Will need to request a return.Anybody else experience this?",G
A great addition to my Elton John collection.  I love it.,e
Amazing job Totally worth the money. Great sound effects and story.,n
"For me, this is one of those gems you fine without actually looking for it. I found this group while watching the movie &#34;The Shunning&#34;.I bought the album just for that one song and didn't get my hopes up for the rest of it. Turned out to be one of those few albums that I will listen to the whole thing and not have to skip a few tracks I can't stand. Looking forward to hearing more from Graylit.",]
This is a great concert and a must have for Dire Strait fans.  This is however not a DVD Audio (will not play in Acura's DVD Audio player) but will play in a DVD video player.,O
Excellent singer and music. If you love her and who doesn't? You will love her music!,a

"I heard Psalm 98 on my local Christian radio station years ago and was so moved by the song that I found the nearest payphone and called the station to find out who sang it, and the name of the album.

"Sarah Vaughn owned the song. ""Send in the Clowns.""  I remember Johnny DanKworth introducing his Wife as ""The Greatest Jaazz Singer in the World.""  I won't mention her name.  She opened with ""Send in...""  Two weeks before we'd been seranaded by Sassy with the same song.  Sorry Johnny, your wife wasn't.",p
An informative and entertaining program.  Obtaining the CDs makes it easier to listen to the music Professor Greenberg mentions in his lectures.  I highly recommend the whole program.,\

"Sadly I lost this CD. However, before I lost it I was bumpin this all day!! How I had not heard this before is just a crime in itself! The sounds these dudes pull off here is a sound that you don't hear too often. It's raw, it's smooth and it has a vibe that can uplift you, break your neck or make you feel like you just got a massage or something. Seriously these cats have some mad skills and I definitely recommend copping this while you can.",d
"I was pretty excited about ordering this CD. I own a Scribbling Idiots CD and thought this one was going to be just as good as that one. I was a little disappointed. A few of the songs sound cheesy, either because of a not so great beat or not so great lyrics. I know Cas Metah and Just Me got skills but this CD wasn't all that great. I either set the bar too high for this CD or they were early into their careers and came off a little weak on this one. I did like a few of the songs so I won't give it anything lower than a 3.",[
"I have this album, purchased for six dollars heaven knows when, and probably decades ago.  There are many interpretations of Kreisleriana; I have two: this one and Cynthia Raim's performance for Connoisseur.  Arrau's performance sounds a bit deliberate, especially the first track: Ausserst bewegt.  Ausserst bewegt is half-etude and half caprice.  It plays with meter much in the same way that Schumann did for quartet 2, opus 41.  The phrases overlap each measure by one triplet sixteenth note, except when they seem to catch their footing, except that they don't.  Great fun.  I prefer Raim's interpretation, because it seems more fluent and sustains clash of lopsided phrasing and the seeming regularity of triplets.  And her interpretation seems to capture the drama.  Arrau does much better with &#34;Sehr innig und nicht zu rasch.&#34;  He takes his time and makes this rather long movement serenely beautiful.  Where he lacks the aggressive energy of Raim's performance on side one, he pulls more emotion out of the music.  On track seven, Sehr rasch, he shows his ability to match anyone's tempo and dynamics.  Amazing.And while this isn't an audiophile-quality performance, and it is close-mic'd, there is plenty of detail in the sustains and mechanics of the piano.  If you like vinyl, this is a pretty decent deal.  But you may find it for a lot less at a local used records store.",F
"This LP was purchased in 2011 as new old stock:  a sealed lp from 1972.  I remember hearing this LP at the local public library as a junior high student and wanting to buy it.  30 years later I have it and it's not all that great.  The LP pressing is noisy and the levels exceed the dynamic range of the LP, so the sound is distorted.  Furthermore, the Partita for Brass Quintet and Tape is all brass and no tape... they actually didn't perform it with the tape accompaniment (unless Lazarof recorded other brass players for playback). I don't think that it is his best work, either.  In summary, I recommend avoiding this LP, which turns up online from time to time as an overpriced item. Instead...Readers of this review should sample the amazing Naxos CD of Tableaux/Symphony #2/Violin concerto.  Lazarof writes great music.  The quality of the recording is top-notch, too.  For that reason, if his music is to your tastes, I would forgo the MP3 format and buy the CD.",y
I love Taemin so I had to buy it. It is definitely new. However it came extremely late. I forgot I even ordered it.,F
love it all,v
"Every song on this album is excellent. I discovered Bacon's voice for the first time while Jopping with SuperM. His voice really surprised me, so I decided to do some research about him. I was thrilled to find out that he had a solo album. This album is a wonderful arrangement of mature R&B. It has that old school '90s R&B vibe and it is refreshing to hear. I received the Night Version and it came with everything listed (Photo Book, Lyric Booklet, CD, Photo Card, Folded Poster).",D
"This album has a nice collection of songs that give off an old school R&B vibe. Yugyeom and JB's voices mend together perfectly. Their song writing skills are fantastic. Focus On Me and Long Black make you go, wow! I wasn't even familiar with the group they came from originally. Jus2 has a totally different vibe from GOT7, so I was surprised these two individuals had so much soul. JB's soundcloud showcases even more of this. They are super talented! Many of these kpop groups have hidden gems of talent that I feel can't really showcase their individual talents. Jus2 is the best sub-unit collab I have heard in kpop. This is a wonderful album and I hope they make another.This album collection has many nice photos. Yugyeom and JB are stunning! The whole concept is very classy and elegant. The poster is much larger than I expected. I loved the extra photocards that came with this. I had to take off one star because the most important thing in this, the cd, had scratches. These scratches caused the songs to skip. I wiped it down and that seems to have remedied the problem. The album was sealed, so I don't know why it had scratches.",H
Nice gospel cd. Love the old school gospel style & flavor. Adding this cd to my workout favs. 😍,c

"Almost needless to say, but I'll just say it: this is for the hardcore Bjork fan. For anyone who knows her history, Tappi Tikarrass was a phenomenal era for her, where with Eyþ&oacute;r &Aacute;rnalds, Jakob Sm&aacute;ri Magn&uacute;sson, Eyj&oacute;lfur J&oacute;hannsson, and Oddur F. Sigurbj&ouml;rnsson, pop and punk was mixed into one stunning, exciting, and stimulating experience. Miranda is their first and only album. A rarity, a one-of-a-kind collector's item, and a true masterpiece of what it was and still is for its time: simply something special.",J
"Of all the limited edition colored vinyls, I'd say that Medulla and Vespertine is the best in quality, sound, art work, and beauty. These albums are already amazing in their own right, but on LP, it's transformed into something out of this world. I LOVE the color for Medulla.

"The best part of ordering this was the nostalgia that came with it. The case was damaged a little but it was made of cardboard/paper material. As far as the cd it was in great condition. Album is amazing, the remake is out now and i have to get that now as well!!!",r

"I really do like the Hypnosis Network Series but I think they are too expensive compared to other cd's readily available. But if you have the money to spend, these cd's are worth the price.  This series, Core Inner Strength, is focused on working on your self-esteem and and self-confidence.  These sessions reminded me very much of the type of session you would undergo if you went to see a psychiatrist that utilized hypnosis in their practice.  There is no background music and no wave sounds. All you hear is Dr. McNeal's calm soothing voice.  She first puts you into hypnosis and then once you are ""under"" and in a safe place she talks to you about trusting and finding your inner voice, self-confidence, self-esteem, and feeling safe in your life.  Again, no bells and whistles or new age stuff but just the type of session that you might get if you went to seek help from professional western doctor to help you regain your self-esteem after some sort of emotional trauma from childhood, a divorce, or mild depression.  I think it would be very good for someone who is healing from an verbally or emotionally abusive relationship and is trying to reconnect to their inner sense of self worth.",y
"Met expectations for relaxing music to add to my collection of stress busting CDs. No virtuoso classical performances here, but worth the very reasonable price for an occasional listen to help you unwind.",x

"Bought first years ago for my granddaughter on DVD, now at age 17 she asked for a cd of it for her birthday!  She still loves it, and they are all from scripture, hence the title.

"Wow, I just can't believe this C.D.  I mean I'm just shocked how good this guy is, and I have never heard him before.  I don't know much, if anything about him, so I didn't expect it would be this good.  It appears he's still alive, 91, and got a handful of Cd's out there I've found on the internet, the most one goes for was 19.99, and most are five buck or less.  I guess the price of a c.d. or how commercial a musician is, or even how many Cd's they have produced does not determine the worth of a musician.We listen to what people promote, what we know of, what's marketed to us, and there are these people out there with amazing talent.  Well I'm probably not going to be a savvy namedropping blue musician reviewer, here.  I do know good music though, even though a matter of taste, this cd. is impeccably recorded and done.I guess I am just wondering how it is that he's not more commercially successful?I love R.L. Burnside, too, but he's prolific with the c.d.'s and even with hooking up with a younger set of commercially successful artists or I'd probably not have found him either.",`
"It's been a long time since I heard a compact disc that was truly unique and somewhat unable to be categorized.  First, it's amazing.  The voices are solid, like a rock opera style in a way, much like Jesus Christ Superstar, the rock opera.  Not exactly, but it reminded me of that.  It's somehow powerful, and mellow at the same time, exciting and full of passion.  I would not normally think a cd was worth this price, but I do with this one.  I wish I knew more about it's origin, where the music comes from, what it's all about, etc.  I do think it has a spiritual quality, and don't know if they are singing about their relationship with God, or a person, or both?I say it is worth it because I would pay that to see them one time, and with the cd, I can hear it over and over again.  Also, because it's unusual, it has grown on me.  At first, the verdict was out. I was not unimpressed, but it did not knock my socks off.  As each song played, I began to say wow, pretty impressive, and then listening to it again, it was a lovely experience.  Worth a try.It looks, from the cover, like your typical &#34;new agey&#34; cd, but it's way beyond that.Also, there is some &#34;techno&#34; like sound in there in certain songs, and usually that turns me off, but it's good music.I mean I do like techno to an extent, but often I find it cheapens music, lowers the class of a piece, but that doesn't seem to happen here. Hope that helps.",W
"I don't know who mixed this c.d., who chose the artists for each song but its a treasure chest of rare, raw, really authentic and soulful musicians that are like best kept secrets in this age of &#34;pop&#34; where many of us want more than banality, whats marketed to us. Crazy interesting and refreshing because of that. Otherwise its a bit dark..but in a good way.",m
"I did not really like this and cannot recommend it.  I'm not a huge fan of this type of music, but I do like it somewhat, esp. songs like Ave Maria.  How could anyone do that one really bad.  It's a great song.  So I liked the style and the songs for the most part, but it was not well done. I was thinking, maybe it's not supposed to be, like your Uncle George singing at your wedding.  I think some of it was kind of sad it was so &#34;roughly,&#34; done, because I can accept it and rejoice when my Uncle sings.  He doesn't have to be a pro.  But, I would never purchase this, and that's about it.",j

"This is one of the early CDs from the ORIGINAL Eden Regained Christian rock band, based in Newark, Ohio, and formed in 1995 with a group of Newark High School students. The band's skilled instrumentations, heavy guitar sound (formed by three guitars plus bass) and beautiful vocal harmonies, along with their good looks, stage presence and message, made them a very popular band in the MIdwest in the mid- to late 1990s. There is another Christian rock band floating around YouTube who has stolen this band's name, but this CD, Once You Move, belongs to the original Eden Regained, who also crafted The Clean EP and Ascension before the band's breakup in 2000.  It must be noted that they toured extensively in the Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Indiana regions and were offered a band showcase in Nashville, where they were offered a contract, but never signed on to tour. On this album, the 6:48 minute ""Shaded"" offers the best on the Once You Move CD, with outstanding guitar and vocal solos. Their all-original songs are all copyrighted and owned by the REAL Eden Regained band members: Nick Bain, Shawn Barrett, Scott Berry, Donny Dixon, and Jason Grady.",F

"Of the 3 volumes of this series that exist, this is by far the easiest session to skip.  WHFS at this stage in their lifespan had lost some of it's indie-cred and that is reflected in the generic artists and song selections for this collection of songs performed in the radio studio.  Recording quality is good...it is sadly the songs that lack any substance.",_
Great CD even if it does not represent their best songs.  Strong recording quality and a very intimate feel. Great for those that have not seen them live or experienced their power on stage.,\
"This Fast Tracks For Men is the first cologne by Watermark Beauty that I really did not like 100%. Don't get me wrong, its okay. But it kind of reminds me of a mix between a manly scent and a feminine scent together. Its not strong, but not sweet either. The scent did not seem to stay on very well and should probably be reapplied at least once in a day, but the 2.4 Fl. Oz. / 70 ml is fairly large and should last.It is supposed to be Inspired By Ferrari Cologne but I have never tried it before so I cant tell you how close it actually is. Its okay, but by far not the best scent by watermark beauty I have smelled so far. I received this product at a discounted rateThanks &#60;3",Q

"Early in their career, the Alan Parsons Project didn't play live.  Alan Parsons knew he would be unable to produce in a live show the excellent production quality he was able to perform in the studio.As technology advanced, that limitation was lifted, and the musical world is a better place for Alan Parsons' frequent concert performances.  I attended one and noticed no dropoff in quality from the cds.  If you have a chance to see him, do so.  He's a unique talent.  Sadly, with the passing of Eric Woolfson, there will not be any new APP music.As for this CD, it's excellent.  That said, if you have all of the APP cds, this is not a must-have.  But, if you want to hear slightly different versions of their numerous great tracks, this provides that, with high quality.",V

My only gripe with this album is that it's missing &#34;Lodi&#34; so unfortunate as this is a great song, very much missed here.  So I really have 19 songs vice the 20 stated on the cover. 4 Stars due to the missing song.",`

"For many people who don't know who she is her music has been played in anime like Bleach.  Some of her music is well known in Korea, USA, Japan, China, Taiwan and Philippines.  This cd is a compiled version of her music selection from 2002-2010.  Her music has won several J-Pop awards.  Now about the cd is awesome.  I bought this because she is a really great singer and her band makes their own music.  For an artist this group of musicians are very talented.  I would highly recommend this cd to anyone who is interested in starting off to gain interest in knowing what J-pop is about.",v
This is an awesome singer very skilled in singing various types of music.  Her music reached the top ten charts in Japan.  She does a lot of pop rock.  This cd was very well worth buying.  The video is a DVD very clear.,H
"The music from her is very playful. She is dressed on th album very cutely.  Also her music sounds pretty innocent.  That is the best to discribe her music.  If anyone would hear this music they would just melt.  I know it is odd coming from a guy but, I show this album to some other people and they were hooked on it.",R
The music fits very well with the tv series.  Aoi Eir has great experience performing her songs.  Each of thing have a different theme that give it a special uniqueness.  My favorite was on track 1 and 5.  It is very well worth listening.,v
Kalafina is very famous all over asia.  This cd was very special for the anime series.  The music is very dynamic and give alot of feelings about the anime.  If you are looking into fate zero the music will give you a great taste of what great anime music should be like.,[

"The singers & orchestra do a good job. The audience is quiet except for some applause and there's very little stage noise. The booklet, in Italian and English includes the complete libretto and has a good ammount of information about the composer, the libretto, the original cast & performance history. It does not have any information about the current cast nor does it have a synopsis of the plot & I was not ready to read the 47 page libretto to learn the plot. Also, there are only 8 tracks per CD which means some of the tracks combine a scene, aria, duet and or chorus all together instead of breaking them up into separate tracks.  Even worse, there are no timings on the tracks. Each CD is approx 64 min and after doing some searching I found the track timings at Presto Music. CD 1 track 1 - 8:12; 2 -2:45; 3 - 1:51; 4 - 5:59; 5 - 11:49; 6 - 12:46; 7 - 4:09; 8 - 17:06. CD 2 track 1 - 12:46; 2 - 6:36; 3 - 6:20; 4 - 7:21; 5 - 4:09; 6 - 9:30; 7 - 10:00; 8 - 6:38. As for Persiani's music it's pleasant with some interesting arias & duets. If you've heard any of the music of his contemporaries such as Morcacchi, Vaccaj, Ricci or Mercadante or one of Donizetti's lesser more slap dash operas you'll have a pretty good idea of what this opera sounds like. If you're looking for something really great from this era & you're tired of the same old Bellini & Donizetti try Meyerbeer's Italian opera & even better the operas of Giovanni Pacini.",y
"This CD includes Franck's three most popular pieces. Recorded in 1959 & 1962 & remastered in 1994-95. Sound quality is very good. The Chassseur & Variations performances are very good. The Symphony, performed by the Philharmonic Orchestra and Constantin Silvestri is a bit slow and lackluster. The 1st & 2nd movements are both about one minuet each slower than another recording I have. That may not sound like much but it does make a difference. If you're going to own only one recording of this symphony, this is not the one to have. I checked & my other, more recent recording is also by the Philharmonic orchestra, but a different conductor (Francesco D'Avalos).  It's much livelier and more satisfying.",w
"Pinto (1785-1806) died at age 20 of TB. These teenage works are so attractive that one wonders what he might have  achieved had he lived a full life. Played on an 1807 Broadwood fortepiano (restored in 1991). Unlike some fortepianos which have an unpleasant sound, the sound of this instrument is very pleasing.",Z
"I owned this recording and having listened to it a couple of times I was always left with the question, why was this opera so famous? It was dull & plodding. Then I bought the 1954 performance by Callas & Corelli and I had an ah ha moment. Listening to that '54 performance compared to this modern performance made me realize what a difference great singers can make. The '54 performance was so great that I now understood why this opera was so famous & highly thought of in it's day. The quality of the recording here is obviously better than the '54 recording, but that's the only good thing I can say about this recording when comparing the two.",J
"A recording of a 1960 performance from La Scala. While not as good as a modern studio recording, the sound is perfectly acceptable. No noise from the stage or audience except very enthusiastic applause. The chorus, orchestra and singers are excellent. Callas is Callas whether you love her voice or hate it (this audience loved her). Corelli, at the height of his career, is the stand out. Incredible, voice, high notes & emotion. I've read that someone thought this opera contained some of Donizetti's best music. I'm not too sure of that. I'm not a big fan of Donizetti though I've heard most of the recordings of his operas. To me, this one falls somewhere in the middle, not the worst, but not up there with his hand full of best operas. There are some pretty exciting arias and duets for Callas & Corelli and some good choruses & act finales. With lesser soloists this opera probably wouldn't sound as good as it does here.",K
"A live recording from Verona, Italy. Very little stage noise & the audience is quiet except for applause after nearly every number. The sound quality is good. The singers, chorus & orchestra all do a fine job. As for the music, while there's nothing here that will keep you ""humming a tune"" ever after, there are many very melodic, pleasant & quite pretty arias & duets to enjoy. This opera wasn't one of Salieri's succeses. Apparently it wasn't the music that was to blame but the story which was about women characters taking on male roles & vice versa & even a gay character. The 1795 audience was not ready & rejected to opera.  If you're a Salieri fan like me this is a must have, if you're just looking to sample one Salieri opera, then the ""Grotto of Trifonio"" or the ""Falstaff"" might be a better choice.",y
"These overtures are better than I thought they'd be. They've inspired me to explore some on Spohr's dramatic work, not just his orchestral & chamber music.",S
"Spontini's fame & reputation rested on his last four operas (La Vestale, Fernan Cortez, Olympie & Agnes de Hohenstaufen). Today only La Vestale keeps his name alive, if just barely. In my opinion, Olympie is the least interesting of the four. Originally written in 1819 for Paris it was a modest success. It was then rewritten in a new German edition for Berlin in 1822 & was much more successful. Then in 1826 the German edition was translated back into French & given in Paris quite successfully. It's the 1826 edition that's recorded here. The singing & orchestra are fine & the music is OK but nowhere as interesting as the music in Fernan Cortez or Agnes de Hohenstaufen. These last two operas however do not exist in modern recordings which is a great pity because in my opinion both are much better than either Vestale or Olympie.",y
"These are the first recordings of these two works. Steinberg (1883-1946) was the son in law of Rimsky Korsikov, the teacher of Shostakovich, & a fellow student with Stravinsky (who he beat out in a competition much to Stravinsky's chagrin over many decades). While Stravinsky went to the West, Steinberg stayed in Russia & remained very little known outside Russia, The two earlier symphonies recorded by Neemi Jarvi are very good in the style of Tchaikovsky & Glauzunov.. These are two later pieces. The symphony is a piece of Soviet ear music commemorating the opening of a railway. Programatic music with folk melodies. Well orchestrated. Worth a listen but not going to be a piece I'll listen to again for a long while. The violin concerto (from 1946) is much better, Very mush in the Romantic idiom, it's a very appealing work.",h
See may review of Bennett's Concerto #3 for my opinion of his 4th Concerto.,r
"A live recording from Turin, Italy in 1974. Audience was very quite. Sung in Italian rather than the original French. Based on the 1817 revision rather than the 1809 original. Sound quality is very good (vastly better than the 1951 Naples recording). Bruno Pevedi (a world class tenor in his day), singing the role of Cortez is outstanding. Chorus & orchestra are also very good, the soprano is the real weak spot for me (especially compared with Renata Tebaldi in the 1951 recording). The opera is wonderful. Some very fine arias & duets & especially outstanding & dramatic writing for the chorus. Why this opera has not had a really good, modern, studio recording is a mystery to me. So many much poorer opera have been recorded over & over I wonder why this very exciting opera has been ignored. To my ear, this opera is much more entertaining than Spontini's vastly better known opera ""La Vestale"". What may have held this opera back is that it has an all male cast except for one soprano & the lead character (Cortez) does not make an appearance until the second act. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys French Grand Opera, Meyerbeer, Halevy's La Juive, etc.",f
Dad was happy thanks,n
Loved it. Thank you,C
"This is one of the finest recordings of cowboy and western songs I've ever heard. I saw them perform at their ranch in Wyoming, and I was captivated by their sound. They have perfect harmonies. It is authentic in its presentation yet contemporary in recording quality. It isn't overflowing with twangy sound, neither is it revved up with modern synthetic background. If you like cowboy and western music, you will love this album!",u

"This band is the best! And this CD captures (almost) the best of Indian Ocean....although I think the compilation has omitted some very good songs of theirs. Still it is a good start for anyone just trying out Indian Ocean's music and sound.The recording is very, very good. There is an amazing amount of low level resolution and imaging is spot on. Drums, gongs cymbals, all come out beautifully! I was pleasantly surprised to find how good the recording is. I am listening to them through a Meridian 588 + Anthem preamp + Bryston monoblocks + Magnepan 3.6Rs. Indian Ocean sounds simply magical. Reminds me of Sheffield Labs recordings ( I have many of their CDs). VERY high resolution.",^

"Had the luck to hear Dalglish and Larsen live a couple times in the SF bay area, late 1970s/early 1980s. Transcendent.

It is truly wonderful.",_
"I was shocked to learn a few minutes ago that Gerry Niewood was among those killed in the Buffalo plane crash.  His album as leader of the group Timepiece has been one of my favorites since college days in the 70s.  I've always considered Niewood to be a pioneer of what became known as ""smooth jazz,"" although Timepiece is several steps above what passes for jazz on commercial FM radio these days.  This is wonderful, engaging relaxing music, and while I'm shocked over Niewood's death, I hope his work will now find a wider audience.",v
"Combining all the bombast and pretension of Coldplay and U2 with songs that rely more on gimmickry than craft (several are more loops than structured songs, with lots of abrupt samples thrown in for, um, who knows why) and kitchen-sink production that strangely makes it sound like speakers are blown on your system on the more bombastic tunes, Imagine Dragons reference everyone from Arctic Monkeys (&#34;I'm So Sorry&#34;) to Ladysmith Black Mambazo (the ubiquitous &#34;I Bet My Life&#34;). They do it fairly well but blaze no new trails of their own, almost always sounding like bonus tracks from other bands' albums. Some bands should be flattered; the aformentioned Coldplay and U2 should sue.",O
Awesome songs,^
I love this album.,u
One of our favorite CDs.,X
Just what I expected if not more.,d
"I bought this for my father whose music collection included this album set in cassette and his new car had only a CD player.He was thrilled.Good remastering to digital, sounds better than the cassettes or the vinyl for that matter, and he is a happy man.Says this is 'his and mom's music'.A great gift for Older Americans who grew up on the music of America's Heartland.",r
excellent purchase,e

"It's Larry Young.'Nuff said.Listening to Larry makes you feel so good,  you might feel as if you were a sick man waiting online.  And you just felt the first invigorating  jolt, from your new &#34;organ&#34; transplant.",c
Bucky's the best.This is TRULY a SOLO masterpiece.Viva La Buck!,G

Price is great,C
"It would have been icing on the cake if they had included the lyrics.  None the less, he's King for a reason.",C
"This is, of course, an unauthorized recording. Every version of this concert I've heard has audible distortion, and judging from the other reviews, this is no exception. Thing is, in late October an official version will be released as part of the Joni Archives Vol 2.",t
"The sound quality is only so-so, and the speed is off. Readily available for cheap on eeb-ay for cheap.",c
"This 3CD boot contains: CD1 Newport Folk Festival 1969 & other random early cuts. Sound VG+ CD 2 Live FM b'cast Netherlands 1983 tour. Full band, great sound. Worth it just for this (also on Youtube) CD 3 Solo Joni 1995 Gene Autry Museum, LA, Excellent sound FM b'cast-also widely available online.",w
"This is one of Air Supply's best cd's and has so many of all the old songs they sang for the past 30 years. I love Air Supply, and have seen them in concert, and have several of their cd's. Just the right kind of music to mellow out and enjoy after a long day. One of the best cd's they have.",B
Enjoyed the CD very much.,Q
"When Buffalo Springfield was on the radios, I was not worried about buying the music, but now, I want to hear the music that I loved then. Just bought all three of their original albums.The music is just as great now as it was then and the clarity is much better.",c

"Michael O'Brien's new CD ""Something About Us"" is one of my new favorites! Meaningful songs, romantic melodies, and his completely beautiful voice makes this CD one that will stay in my collection for years to come.",e
GREAT worship cd! This is a very anointed cd I love the worship!I would recommend. ITs GREAT to listen to!,q
"I was fortunate enough to be present for this live recording.  It was and still is a beautiful set, I love her use of strings in this recording.  The musical element is powerful and stirring just as much as the words.  The songs are amazing, and as always, Kim brings the Presence!",f
beautiful mariachi & synfonic orchastra collabaration,^
Great as expected,z
"I remember these songs on LP's from back in the 50's & 60's, always good to find CD's that sound this good. &#34;El Tariacuri&#34; at his best.",H
"This book is packed with interesting facts and social commentary, and I enjoyed it enough to immediately start another Picoult book. That said, two crucial characters keep withholding information from a murder case — with other characters even imploring them “Don’t tell me” — in a way that feels a bit contrived. Sure, there are reasons, but I think the book could've been even better if those secrets weren’t saved for the end. Still, Picoult makes an important point entertaining when it could've easily been dull or depressing: how poorly set up our judicial and prison systems are for handling anyone who’s even a little bit different. Grade: B+",W
"Kind of a young adult version of &#34;Oryx & Crake&#34; where teens navigate what they think is an awesome world but is really a dystopian future dominated by corporate advertising and the protection of Americans from knowing about the damage caused elsewhere in the world by their habits. People have chat feeds and shopping recommendations plugged directly into their bodies from birth. It took a bit to get used to the language because nearly every sentence is in teenspeak but you soon realize the entire society is this way — even the parents are, like, &#34;Dude&#34; and &#34;Whatev.&#34; Their limited vocabulary weakens their ability to express their emotions when things start to go wrong. I'm not sure how the book will &#34;read&#34; but the audio version was fantastic, with fully produced commercials between chapters. The book is better the more I think about it. Bechdel test: pass. Grade: A-",S
"good CD.  has some great one hit wonders by the original artist, and seems to be a good recording.",Z
good CD.  good recording.  original hits and by the original artists.  sounds great.,s
good CD.  too bad it don't have it might as well rain until September  on it.,I
"I like this, but it is a bit weak, it don't have all the recordings from the EP, Follow that Dream.  I don't understand what is what on the track listings, but some of the songs were OK, even though I did not quite place them.",K
"I love this CD.  1 bestknown single is on it.  Playgirl sounds just like the hit 45 single.FYI; if you must ask, this sounds great sober, or drunk.",r
"1 song on this CD is very well known, at one time.  Chirpy Chirpy, Cheep, cheep.I apreciate the full unedited hit version on this CD.",F
"this CD has Donnies 3 biggest hits on it.  they all seem to be of excellent quality and are the original top 40 hit versions.  this CD can be a little hard to find anymore.  these CDs can be scalped on the prices, sometimes, so I was glad to find a good price.  there is a seller or2 or more that may say the scalped prices are the best I can find, but the price I paid, has undersold them by a large amount.",x
"this cd was at 1 time misunderstood by me.  after listening thru a few times, I find that it indeed has the original hit of breaking up is hard to do by Jivin Genethis is realy a good CD.  I love it.",s
"there are some good tracks on this CD.  I would want to be sure they are good recordings.  if they are good recordings, that would make this a very good CD.",U
Beautiful songs and singing by this talented Taiwan singer.  It is out of print almost everywhere.  I am glad I could purchase it here at such a low price.,i
"Thanks to this recording, we finally get to know how a Kleiber's Mahler would sound like.  Unless you are paying some offshore sellers near $100 for this CD ... the experience alone is well worth the price (near double of other classical music CDs in Amazon)Like one of the reviewers has mentioned, the tempo for 'Abschied' is indeed curiously on the fast side.  The pace is more curious than the fact why Kleiber choose to conduct a Mahler piece at all.  Perhaps the Mahler revival in the 60's had motivated him enough?  But why the fast tempo?Nevertheless, IMHO, Das Lied is Mahler's farewell piece, not a death bed piece like the 9th or the 10th.  It is like how we get used to numerous versions of comatose Faun (Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune) or Mahler 9th.  Kleiber's choice of tempo seems right to me.I am so very grateful to own this CD",a
"I believe this is one of Jim's best! I can say after many many personal development cd's I've used over the past 25 years, this is in my top 5 of programs. What a great man! If you only retain or learn a fraction of this material, you will benefit immensely.",k
I love it! Thank you!! So cuddly and soft.,G
"Listening to this album reminded me of being at a John Denver concert. Bevan does an awesome job at singing John Denver songs. It would be great if he went on tour here in the US, I would be there.",K
Okay,V
My children love this story and often act it out. The recording is well done and the songs catchy for children. The story of children “becoming” brownies to help with chores is charming and a cute twist.,J
I like it.,V
I bought the album to support NU'EST and it's one of my favorite albums! Amazing songs and beautiful photos are included. Please support them!,\
Love the CD/DVD Combo! Fantastic Performance!,x
"This is really junk junk.  Normally I read reviews, but I was in a rush and only looked at stars.  Now after I got the hose and tried it out and saw how bad it was I went back to read the reviews.  The only good reviews were written by people who are from the seller and who have  been given a &#34;discounted&#34; (I assume free) hose to test and give an &#34;unbiased&#34; report on it.  All the bad reports were given by innocent people like me that trusted the stars.  I thought Amazon had solved this problem of fake reviews.Anyway, the nozzle did not attach properly to the hose because the threads don't match up so it leaked badly.  This problem is compounded by the fact that the nozzle once attached cannot be removed because the nozzle threads onto a fitting that has a separate set of threads in the back which thread directly to the hose.  So when you try to remove the nozzle you end up unthreading the valve that the nozzle threads into.  There is no place to put a wrench on to keep everything from spinning. It is hard to describe, but trust me you can't remove the nozzle.The holder is a thin piece of metal with no holes to put screws in so it can be mounted.So I am returning it as you will too if you buy it.  I never actually got to see how long the hose lasts.  I refer you to the other one star reviews for that information.  Good luck.",m
"2 CDs for next to nothing, how can you beat that?  The music is VERY relaxing--great background music, fine for meditation too.  Versatile Telemann.",H
