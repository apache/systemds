# Generator of random records with boolean features

# Cell[1, 1] has the highest probability to be 1, also input 

# By setting num_features >> num_records we allow lots of rare
# features while keeping most records nonempty.
# The power ("pow") in the power law determines the tail behavior;
# The additive ("add") determines how steeply the density changes
#   in the first few records or features.
