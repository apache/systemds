# How to invoke this dml script ScaleScale.dml?
# Assume $SS_HOME is set to the home of the dml script
# Assume input and output directories are on hdfs as INPUT_DIR and OUTPUT_DIR
# Assume X and Y are scale variables and both have 100000 rows
# hadoop jar SystemML.jar -f $SS_HOME/ScaleScale.dml -args "$INPUT_DIR/X" 100000 "$INPUT_DIR/Y" "$INPUT_DIR/WM" "$OUPUT_DIR/PearsonR"

#X <- scale variable
#Y <- scale variable
#WM <- weights

X = read($1, rows=$2, cols=1, format="text");
Y = read($3, rows=$2, cols=1, format="text");
WM = read($4, rows=$2, cols=1, format="text");

W = sum(WM);

# weighted co-variance
covXY = cov(X,Y,WM);

# compute standard deviations for both X and Y by computing 2^nd central moment
m2X = moment(X,WM,2);
m2Y = moment(Y,WM,2);
sigmaX = sqrt(m2X * (W/(W-1.0)) );
sigmaY = sqrt(m2Y * (W/(W-1.0)) );

# Pearson's R
R = covXY / (sigmaX*sigmaY);

write(R, $5);
