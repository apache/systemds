# Assume input and output directories are on hdfs as INPUT_DIR and OUTPUT_DIR
# Assume rows = 1000 and cols = 1000 for G,  rows = 1000 and cols = 1 for authorities, max_iteration = 2
# hadoop jar SystemML.jar -f $HITS_HOME/HITS.dml -args "$INPUT_DIR/G" 2 1000 1000 0.000001 "$OUPUT_DIR/hubs" "$OUTPUT_DIR/authorities"
