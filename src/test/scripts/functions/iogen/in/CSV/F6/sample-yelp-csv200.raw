The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.

Now its a bunch of neanderthal bouncers hopped up on steroids acting like the can do whatever they want. There are so many better places in davis square where they are glad you are visiting their business. Sad that the burren is now the worst place in davis.

I had the EGGMEATMUFFIN, the bread was toasted perfectly and the bacon was a real thick cut. Not that lame bacon we are more familiar with at your conventional breakfast diner. In addition, the place was clean and the staff was very helpful. The butcher had several different cuts available and was knowledgable as well as friendly. I left with some cuts of pork and beef and am excited to come back!

I am not a chowda person but all there soups I have had are pretty damn good.  Broccoli chicken is my favorite.  Also, probably the most personable Food court staff I have ever had the pleasure of ordering from.

I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.The second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.The only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.The last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.

I sat down at the bar while my boyfriend parked the car. Although the restaurant/bar was packed and LOUD, the bartender  (Vanessa) came over within a minute. Prompt service with a smile. When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later, we didn't see Vanessa behind the bar so we tried to flag down her male coworker. He was caught up watching the fight and it took a few minutes to get his attention - which is fine. Not fine, however, is that after I ordered a beer, he stood and texted for a few minutes before getting my beer and held his arm up to shield his texting from management lol. Vanessa, however, is an excellent bartender!! As loud as it is in this place, she continually scanned the bar looking for people attempting to make eye contact with her for service. I watched her work (my boyfriend and I have thirty years of food and beverage experience between the two of us) and she was focused and productive, but most importantly, she was ATTENTIVE! Give this girl a raise!!

I've only been once but I keep meaning to go back as it was so great (just a bit out of my way). I went with a fairly large group so we'd all ordered something different (back when it was $6 for everything, it looks like they've changed that now). At the time I got the chickpea fries, which were delicious but watch out for the fiber because I had to sit out of an entire board game. The board game selection was great, and I love that they serve mead (though I didn't get any at 12 pm haha).  The molten lava chocolate cake was so, so good. Seriously.The real topping to the experience (other than the great service and the fact that they put lemons in their complimentary ice water) was that they were playing Siouxsie and the Banshees in the background! That + board games + good food + mead = I'm a fan forever.

Our family has been coming to Dandy Donuts for years!  Their donuts can't be beat and are a must-try.   The same Cambodian family has owned this shop for years. They are kind, hard-working folks that put out a consistently fresh and delicious line of donuts as well as croissants and apple fritters their customers love.   Subs are also good.   I notice they've added a new low-price lunch special of hot dog, chips and drink.  The surroundings are definitely hole-in-the-wall, but go and try the donuts.

Loved the soup base but especially loved the size of the bowl...unlike most ramen place, the size of the bowl reflected the quantity of the content in it.  Totally looking forward to going back so I can customize my next bowl of ramen...will select thicker noodle for sure and perhaps add more ramen!Fabulous service and loved that they had a sign advising ppl to come in, write down name then wait outside, so not to clog the entrance/exit.Great ramen place, but won't go with a group larger than 4 ppl.  Heads up, there was only one high chair.

The 1 star isn't for the place or for the service. The 1 star is for the management. You give absolutely zero respect to the game of soccer.I've been coming here since you opened and I've seen numerous times where you understaff for finals of tournaments where years past have shown you will be at capacity. It's a shame you have a great establishment and great employees. If only management could sort it out this place would be 5 stars

Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn't want the $5 Mystery Monday meal (biscuits and gravy with a fried egg - looked good when I saw James H.'s, Emily R.'s and Alain L.'s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly-tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway!I wanted the company and I'm so used to dining out, I couldn't resist, I suppose!!Long story short, the service was Capital-B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.'s grits side and Emily R.'s fries were either forgotten (the former) or delayed and without steak sauce (the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected . . . only to find that each one had a 20% service charge tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto-add for big parties. Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often-enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar face - and we're Yelpers, so we're gonna tip you (oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp-n-grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl . . . no one was gonna stiff them!).Still, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, hey, bad night. Then . . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for-freakin'-ever to bring checks, and b) (the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.'s to-go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers (note: not ours) eating some of Ron's wings at the bar with regulars (as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud.So when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were nonplussed and, as I stated to him, he should remove the automatic 20% service charge if he'd included it. A couple minutes later, Ron came out to chat.I have to say . . . I'm a little bit embarrassed because I'm not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it's a gracious gesture on management's part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy . . . and that Ron didn't really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and agreed with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn't *really* care, he noted he'd worked 80 or 90 hours in the last week (ok, but you're the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy . . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge . . . and then he said I can see where this is going . . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.Well, sh*t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get *me* (us) to STHU. And then . . . how do I tip on a non-dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary's once noting how sloooow everyone's food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a freebie given my week of Eat On $30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly (not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a service charge and we didn't) and while Emily tipped for me since I didn't eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought . . . Huh?? What just happened??Monday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling -and still feel - like I need to *digest* my most recent experience . . .

Don't let the inside-a-bar vibe scare you away. WE LOVE HAPPY FORTUNE. Just thinking about it makes me want to go there right now. Plus.. they have great prices. Here's some of our favorites over the years: General Tso's (nice and spicy), the crab puffs, lo-mein. The service is great -- cheap drinks, while you're waiting, from plucky, yet-very-nice bartenders. Interesting people watching, but make sure to order from the bar-side of the place for that.

I work on Krog Street, so figured I would give it a shot today. The line was VERY Long (about 10 people deep), which must mean it is good. I waited, and waited, and waited in line for about 20 minutes. My co-workers went to Fred's and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on moving orders through the line.It's basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma ($8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $6.50 or $7.They did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. Food wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great. Service wise, I would have to give them a 2 as the wait was terrible! 20 minutes in line is crazy for only having about 10 people in line. Good food, but the prices are very high too.

Be forewarned that it's not a nice restaurant like the Flying Biscuit or Mary Macs so adjust your expectations for decor and service.  My husband and I are not from the South but as we ate our way through Atlanta, the Busy Bee Cafe ranked #1 on both our lists.Pros  - BEST FRIED CHICKEN WE'VE EVER HAD...perfectly crispy skin with     great flavor. It seriously makes me not very excited to eat fried chicken     anytime soon because I know anywhere I go in Boston won't be as     good.  - Ribs with a nice, smokey taste  - Super mac n' cheese made with real cheese  - Dang good corn muffins you can munch on before your food arrives.Cons  - Very busy so be prepared to wait (and you should because it's worth it)  - No air conditioning so in the summer it can get pretty toasty.  We were     there at the end of June and even with the fans going, it was warm.  - Sweet tea is too sweet for me**Note: There's a small parking lot as well as street parking.  However if you park on the street, the meters are really expensive...something crazy like $2 an hour.

I got the fried haddock sandwich with fries.  The fries were frozen and greasy..  The haddock sandwich was not good.  Tasted  very fishy and frozen.  I had such high hopes their take out would be good.

It has been okay in the past, but today, the service was a failure on multiple levels. First, it look a long time for my food to come out, and the waitress initially brought the wrong order. Then, it look 20 minutes before I was able to chase down the waitress to pay my check. Finally, when I received my check, they charged dinner pricing for a lunch. I was running late to get back to the office, so I paid it, but all said, the service was inexcusable. I write in the hopes that you will take corrective action, whether in coaching your staff, or hiring more people for the lunch rush.

We ordered escargot and artichoke to start. Escargot was covered in a bitter green sauce- butter and garlic would have really helped. The artichoke wasn't cooked properly and was minimally seasoned. It was also small portions, about a fourth of an artichoke in size. Even after sending back the artichoke it still was tough and not fully cooked. We ordered the lamb chops for our main with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were sour and not as creamy as expected. For $35 we received two lamb chops with a tasty mustard sauce but the accompanying vegetables were tasteless and again, disappointing. The ambiance and service was great and we had a yummy creme brûlée brought to our table for the birthday we were celebrating but we wished the rest of the meal had lived up to the hype.

Two to three can definitely share. I'm a vegetarian and was going to order the La Bandita. However, the waitress suggested the goodnight burger with a veggie patty. It sounded great so I opted to try it. After all, this was my first visit to a Hopdoddy and she would know better than I would. Despite the different elements, the burger to me was very bland. The patty didn't have much flavor and there wasn't much sauce. (When the waitress pitched the burger, she said it have more flavor than the La Bandita because of the sauce. Since I'm all about the sauce, it helped to sell me on this burger.) Just a note on the Impossible burger: I'm a vegetarian that does not miss meat or the flavor of meat. Because this burger tries to replicate the texture and flavor or meat, it really turned me off.My husband went with the classic and added bacon and cheese. The burger arrived with only cheese (no bacon). He said it was alright but he didn't rave about it in a way that told me he was in love with it.We ordered a banana shake that was one of their feature items. It wasn't as thick and not ice cold as we would expect for a shake. It was much closer to room temperature and had a thin consistency.Would I go back? Maybe. I would definitely try the La Bandita to give that burger a shot. A quick note about the line: it moved pretty quickly. Once we got inside, a couple of spots opened up at the bar and the waitress invited us over to sit there. We jumped at the opportunity and saved about another 10 minutes in line.

Our waitress sounded like a robot, and we had to grab another waiter several times because she never came back to check on us. The food came out and it looked like it had been sitting in the back a while, it was barely warm and a film had formed over the top of my ravioli. Overall, very unimpressed and I don't think I would go back or recommend this location to a friend.

However, I have to give them props because it seems like they're using Yelp in the right way - they're using it to get a consensus and improve on things. I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I've been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I've been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that's what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren't, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito (I didn't want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his.There were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There's nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn't say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda meh on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren't that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago.I will say though, that the potato and green chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I'm kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn't pay extra, that wasn't really a deal breaker for me.I definitely will be coming back here. They have ample parking, the space is really nice, and I really appreciate the fact that they seem to be doing their homework and improving what they can. I really think if they continue the way that they are, that this place will just get better with time.

We were literally the only table in the restaurant taken. We had like 3 different waiters. Appetizers all came out within like 5-10 min intervals of each other. All 3 of us ordered 2 different rolls and it took like 30 mins to come out. Sushi was alright but I would say to much for the quality.

The rest is spent waiting.  Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently takes 45 minutes to make.  Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something?  Who knows.  But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.The service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.Anyway.  I get it isn't the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don't want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.

I wonder why the reviews were so low. I entered without looking at yelp initially but then after checking in and seeing the amount of stars I kind of grew the assumption that it wasn't going to be good.  But it was really good. This was probably the best falafel wrap I ever had. They pressed the wrap too so it has a nice crunch but still soft to chew. The falafels weren't bland and each bite tasted the same, which makes wraps great, since it's evenly disturbed. They are far from cheap on the stuffing so eat up! The wait time wasn't long during their busy time and it's a good portion for a hungry person, so I suggest checking this place out.

I know coffee, am passionate about coffee, and Im always looking for the best roaster out there.  George Howell is a legend but the coffee here is honestly not that impressive.One story - I ordered an Ethiopian pour over and asked for it to be made on the machine instead of by hand as I wanted to watch the machine in action. I paid $4 with my CC. I was then told that they don't have any Ethiopian but they would make me Kenyan which is very similar (not in my opinion but ok I'll go with it - there was Ethiopian on the shelf so I'm a little confused... why can you just go grab it and make it for me? That is what I ordered.)  Next I'm told they can't use the machine because it isn't on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes. And after drinking it I am never asked how it was, if I was ok with them switching out the coffee I ordered.  I don't know about you but I expect more. I've decided that my coffee money is better spent elsewhere supporting people and roasters that are starting out. Sorry George, but ya let me down.

We were basically seated at a table by the host, then told quite rudely by the server that we couldn't sit there.  Then we proceeded to watch as the host and server fought over whether we could sit there or not (while we were trying to scurry away).  Finally we were moved to another server's section, who basically treated us like crap as well.I really can't figure out why we stayed?  Cheap beer, I guess.   The food is unremarkable (good wings, though), parking is a pain, and there are so many better places to go.

The variety is endless and they are constantly adding new menu items. The Snap team is super friendly and helpful. Almost every time I ask them how a certain item is that I haven't tried yet, they offer to buy it for me so I can try it risk-free. Their food is fresh, delicious, healthy, and easy. What more can you ask for!? Snap for President.Tip: Anytime I eat these at home (instead of work) I heat them up in a skillet on the stovetop. It's tasty, microwave-free AND it feels home-cooked. :)

Or one of their funky pizza slice creations (hotdog pizza ect)! They have some good alcohol prices and a good atmosphere. During dinner it's always packed though so be prepared to sit out back!

I've had Ethiopian in DC (which is the best I've tried) but this place is a close runner up.The boyfriend and I came in on a Wednesday night and were seated immediately. We first got the honey wine which was really sweet and syrupy. It reminded me of mead. Then we got the meat combo and everything was tender, delicious and flavorful. They certainly don't skip on the injera here. My favorite part about this place specifically is that they serve the food traditional style in colorful baskets! I've never seen that before and it made the experience that much better :)

I've never had a problem, the service is always top notch, and the place is always squeaky clean - dining area, exterior, bathrooms, even the kitchen appears much cleaner than other fast food place from what I can see. I love their fried chicken liver and the manager told me that because they make each batch fresh that they are happy to take my order over the phone if I call ahead so that I don't have to wait at the restaurant for the 6 minutes or so that it takes to cook. I live just down the street and I have taken them up on this offer several times. Even if it's just one order of 6 chicken livers, they are happy to cook them up fresh so they are ready when I arrive. Now THAT is exceptional customer service. Thanks Chicken E!

However, after eating there about 12-15 times (usually the same dish), I noticed the portions were smaller than ever.  I asked the waitress, and she said it's the same as always.  She's been there for a while, so she obviously knows the difference and is just denying it.  It's not my imagination because my wife noticed my plate and said the same thing.  I ordered a combo plate that you can choose up to four items.  I wanted three, and asked to just double up on the eggplant (which I ALWAYS do). The waitress said there would be a $2 up charge to double eggplant or babaganoush.  I looked at the menu, and the appetizer portion (which is bigger than the combo portion) of eggplant is only $1 more than the other items.  So where did the other dollar come from??  The babaganoush was the exact same price on the appetizer menu as the other items!  So where did the $2 up charge come from??  It made no sense to me whatsoever, but I did't feel like arguing about it.  Even if there was a legitimate reason for the up charge, they should have it on the menu, like they do for grape leaves.  The whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth.  Like I said, the food is tasty, but I might boycott this place just for the principal of it.

Every single dish. I ordered the mofongo de camarones (shrimp with mashed plantain). The shrimp came separate, and the garlic sauce lacked any flavor - it didn't even taste like garlic! The sauce that typically comes with this dish (in a separate cup) looked and tasted like oil. So gross.I would never eat here again.

Manager offered discounts because everyone else in my party ate but me, and still charged me for bad food. Stay away. Place next door (Hennessy's) had great food and specials. Thanks for charging me for food I didn't eat and trying to pacify me with discounts you never applied.

Everyone is so friendly and helpful, the chef even came over and said hi. I ordered the duck, it was delicious, very flavorful! The only complaint I had was that it was just duck, no side. Although it was good it was a little weird to eat just duck for dinner.

They said it was halal and the Arab owners confirmed that it was. This is a nice, downtown spot across the street from the park and right next to the Park Street subway station.We enjoyed the chicken kabob and baked haddock dinners, which both came with rice and salad. Very enjoyable, hot and fresh food. When I went to buy some rice pudding for dessert, the owner gave it to us for free. What a nice touch. InshaAllah my wife and I will return soon.

Initially, we went there to get a special milkshake.  They serve shakes with a little alcohol.  Yes, a little alcohol.The decor at Grub Burger is modern.  Sleek.  We were confused at first when we arrived, but a server came up and explained for us to take a menu and order in the back.  Drew and I shared The Front Porch burger (just a regular burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.) cooked medium-well, onion ring and a Java Jitters spiked milkshake.The Front Porch Burger was delicious. The meat was fresh and tasted like a burger should taste.  They advertise on their menu that the hamburger is actually brisket and ground chuck.    I loved the bun.The Java Jitters milkshake was too sweet and I really did not like the big straw.  Also, there is very little alcohol.  i prefer Grindhouse milkshakes instead.The onion rings lacked seasoning. Very bland.They had other menu items that is different from other burger joints like Burgers That Don't Moo, crawfish pistolettes and they have an array of signature drinks. Overall, I'll be back and would recommend this restaurant.

Never heard of the place, never even been in the area before.Yes, the food was somewhat pricey. Everything we had was great. And for the decor, some say tacky, but this is part of what makes this place special.I stepped outside with my coffee to catch a quick smoke, and when I re-entered the restaurant, there was fog, colored lights, a variety of hats came off the walls onto children's heads,and some faster faced music was pumping. Again, this is what makes this restaurant unique. All in all, I liked this place. Has some character and if I visit the area again with a craving for Italian, I will try to revisit.

They're making a killing on food profit.My husband and I shared the pick two cold appetizers (we chose babaganoush and hummus).  It came out on a small saucer and contained maybe a 1/2 c of each for $10.75.  I asked if it came with bread and they said no you have to pay for that separate so that was another $5 for the lavas bread (what was I suppose to eat with the dips).  Then we split their house salad, which was priced at $10.75 (no protein added) and it was a basic sized salad with lettuce, some cous cous, 2 olives, some feta, tomato and cucumber.I know I will not come back to eat here.  I can find the same type of food that taste just as great and pay the price that it should be.

A crab roll comes on a buttered & grilled roll so light it's almost ethereal. Really it's an amazing roll and just amplifies the quality of the crabmeat. The salads are terrific but the best part might be the servers. Warm, attentive and helpful, just trust me- you'll eat here every chance you get!

I'm a spicy food fan with a fire resistant pallete, but the hot sauce with the otherwise-excellent chicken wings was WAY over applied and actually ruined my whole dinner.  Service has gotten slow, forgetful and a little too cool for school (second time we've noticed this...).

It definetely stands out among all the sub-par Indian food in the Boston/Allston area.For about $26 I have an entree (chicken tikka masala, my favorite), an appetizer sample platter (non-vegetarian, fyi), and onion pratha, a thick chewy slice of whole wheat bread with onions. Enough to last me for three meals, provided I stuff my self silly. So I may not know authenticity but I've had enough Chicken Tikka Masala to know good from bad. This was goooood... The mild spice level had plenty of flavor and kick. It was slightly creamy but moreso heavy on bold tomato flavor. Amazing. Finally something that doesn't taste like a school cafeteria's interpretation. The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting. I'm not sure how onion pratha is supposed to taste, but I enjoyed it anyway.AND to top it off, the delivery guy walked the food up to my door, was polite, friendly, and wished me a good night. Love this place.

Excited to try what I remember to be great coffee, I ordered my food and a Lavender Mocha. We watched as they prepared our coffee. When it was done, however, instead of serving it to us (seated right in front of them), the coffees were put a few feet away (within arms reach) on the till. We waited and watched as the coffees just sat there. Several waitresses passed by ignoring the coffees. After 10 minutes somebody decided to finally serve them. They were completely cold. I really don't see why this happened. We both ordered Cassoulet. It was bland, greasy and low quality. I'm surprised to say that the Tangine I ordered the last time I was here was actually better tasting, which is rather sad as I imagined the Tangine was a bad exception. There are some things that were still delicious. I love the waffles still. And the focaccia is great. But for the high expectations that arise from the price, hype and 45 minute wait each time, Cafe Medina is absolutely awful.

A few things were not as good as I expected: Sangria (Margarita was better but still low on alcohol), Chicharrones (very tough, if you like hard meat they are for you), Yuca Frita (they look like mozzarella sticks, quite odd), Mofongo was weak too.The drinks we tried were not very alcoholic and excessively sweet so I would just stick to a beer (Corona) unless you just love sugary drinks. The last complaint I have is that the temperature on a Fri afternoon was surprisingly low in there. It was as though they didn't want to turn on the heat which is a real drag in Boston. This was our second time there and we didn't have that issue the first time (fri night) so perhaps it was just a strange oddity.

The food was awesome and the servings were large! The first and third day we had breakfast there the service was so amazing! The two different ladies were very attentive and super friendly. The second day (different lady) was not as great but she was busy and alone so I will give her that. The place was very clean and a great atmosphere. Definitely recommended!

And guess what I definitely  love the food  hands down. It was very clean and also a nice bar you can even set outside for that summer  fun. Try them for yourself. I'll  be a regular ....

They have pretty high quality amazing-tasting food, and always change up their menu so you aren't always ordering a normal burrito. I love the burrito bowls, personally.

The donuts here are just mouth watering and glorious to look at while being in line because for one they are moist and not overall sweet for anyone who may be a sweet tooth.Great thing to know is that the lines aren't too long which you may have imaged and I have to say its not like Voodoo donuts and that's for sure.

I have always loved Thai food and was a fan of Brown Sugar while in college.  When I moved to Fenway and heard that Thaitation was related to Brown Sugar..I was skeptical.  Brown Sugar, in my opinon, had fallen a bit so I was not sure how great Thaitation would be.I was wrong.  Thaitation is just delicious.  Brown Sugar is no longer a place in my go to restaurants and I have convinced all of my college friends that it is no longer worth the trip and Thaitation is the place to be!Pad thai, broccoli with tofu and mushrooms, wonton soup, mango curry...I could go on for days!  I also love that I can usually get two meals out of an entree so the prices don't seem too steep.Great Quality, Quantity...what more could you ask for?!

However, after my Caesar salad with grilled shrimp ($8 additional) showed up, I was less than impressed. This dish comes with 4 pretty small grilled shrimp, that should really only be worth $4 at most. I even asked the waitress if that was all the shrimp it came with and she confirmed it was. Will not return to this restaurant as I don't feel at all that I got a meal worth what I paid.

When I made the reservation they asked if it was for a special occasion and I told them it was for a birthday.  Everyone who came to our table knew and made sure to wish him a happy birthday.  We ordered the special appetizer which was a nice assortment of scallops, shrimp, mussels, and some sort of white fish in a tomato sauce.  He got the skate fish and I ordered the halibut.  Both were impressive and were lightly seasoned so that you could taste the natural flavor.  The reason we are giving this place 5 stars is because of the service.  It was remarkable.  The waiter accidentally spilled my water and you would have thought there was a fire by how many of the staff responded.  The manager also came over to apologize.  The waiter was very knowledgeable about the fish selection as well as the wine.  They even gave us pistachio ice cream, baklava, and homemade donuts as a birthday dessert.

Music playing, an older crowd (wouldn't recommend for families since it was just so loud and dark). We ordered a variety of items and the food was just ok. I was expecting more because of the price point and the location.  The worst was the sushi. I don't think I'll be back. Just not my cup of tea.

You can keep eating for hours if you want, and they just keep on refilling your broth and items if you ask them for it.  They don't exactly offer to bring you things without you asking, but they were not the least bit rude about giving us another check off sheet. We had the chef's special broth and it was extremely bland, but the dipping sauce (satay and soy based) was not too bad.  I would try a different broth with a little more flavor next time.We had a ton of stuff, but our favorites were the kobe beef, the scallion dumplings, the taro root, the salmon, and the absolutely delicious crab legs- we got two orders!!  Really you can't go wrong here- unless you are bothered by the slightly fishy smell when you first walk in.  But you get used to it!  For $20.00 this is about the best deal in China Town.

A huge variety too for those picky eaters that can't decide on what to settle for. Come with an empty stomach and enjoy a great turkey and ranch or one of their other 100 subs!

If you're in JP and craving Indian - come here. Or if you're in Brookline, Cambridge, Somerville...jump on the 39 and get over here. Get the chicken curry.  Another recommendation is the duck on the chef's special list.

The service on he other hand has always always been bad. The waiters always leave you hanging, the owner is rude and, sad to say, ghetto in front of customers. Again, the food is spot on but the service is horrible. I have been coming here for years and it never changes. We are here today, the first time in a couple months and they have renovated. They have expanded into the unit next door. Good renovation, bigger space, better decor. Still a ways to go before it is finished but good. Wish the service was better, unfortunately I doubt I will return. I think today was it.

Once a summer, when visiting our family in the city, we would go to the Barking Crab for some decent food and wonderful atmosphere. Sadly, once I became vegetarian, the menu became extremely limited for me, which made it much less appealing. But still, many happy memories from the Barking Crab! Great family place!

It really doesn't even matter if they're busy or not nor does it matter what you order it will be a long time before they bring it. I must admit other than that it's a cool dive bar.

I went on a Friday night with friends and saw multiple live music performances. We had to wait in line for a little while but the man at the front made it go by quicker by asking us trivia questions. There was a fair amount of seating and my group of 6 didn't have trouble finding a table. I got the sour guava for my first drink which I enjoyed. The second I had was their milk stout. It was fine but I can say I've had better. I really liked their 'bevi' station with sparkling and still water with different flavors, it was a nice touch. Some things I didn't take advantage of was the chocolate bar, the arcade games, or the tasting room restaurant in the back, but definitely things I want to try next time I'm there!

There were a couple of snafus - my soup was taken to the wrong table - which the wait staff made up for with cups of another soup to tide me over.  Staff was also very sensitive to my food allergies, and made sure there was no cross contamination in the kitchen. I was pleasantly surprised at how well children are accommodated.  There's a dedicated child's menu with low cost (around $5) entrees, and crayons for coloring.  (The kids' food was great, too.)

How hard is it to take and order and fill it?  All we asked for was a salad and a pizza and for the second time in a row, no salad arrived.  At least they didn't put it on the bill this time.   I can understand if the place is jamming, but it was dead in there at 8 PM.  Maybe the staff should spend less time hanging out together behind the bar, flexing, talking about drinking and plans for later and spend some time doing their jobs.  And the pizza was only fair, not the usual excellent.  Not a good showing last night.  It will be a long time before we return, if we do return.   Great pizza can overcome poor service, but fair pizza and poor service?  That's a tough sell.

The hostess and waiter were incredibly accommodating and kind to us. The service was fantastic and the  food was delicious and fresh! We all had a special pesto linguini with seafood (lobster, jumbo shrimp, and scallops). It was out of this world!  We will definitely be coming back many times!! Totally recommend if you are looking for great food, great atmosphere, and amazing service!

Well, this I have to see. I took 4 friends to this restaurant and of course, I was very skeptical. We sat down and had the chips with salsa. The salsa was spicy and tasty and I actually requested more. Our meals included Steak Tampiquena, Flautas, Original El Paso Enchiladas, The Texican dinner and of course, one of my favorite dishes, Carne Chile Colorado. I know what El Paso Chile Colorado should taste like so when I took a bite of The Texican's Chile Colorado, my taste buds were the happiest they had been in a long time. I also tried the other plates and this is definitely the Chicano food from back in El Paso. All my guests enjoyed their meals as I did. The food tastes like grandma's food back home. I was truly surprised and delighted. When I feel like eating a great meal from back home, you can bet I will come back here. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. For all you original El Pasoens in Austin, this place is for you, but sorry they don't serve Chico's Tacos (El Paso humor) lol. I recommend this place for anyone, it is a great place to eat.

Service is so slow, calling it fast food is misleading. 1st time: went to the restaurant to place an order - wait time 20 mins.2nd time: placed an order online to save time. Got to the place in 20 mins as per the online order, the ORDER NEVER WENT through. Guess what - ANOTHER 20 mins to prepare the food. 40 MINS for Fast Food... Really!!???

By soaking myself in sushi goodness, I might forget that I have to pack still, have 10,000 emails that piled up during my 5 days of death by powerpoint.Anyway, the sushi here was tremendous. The edamame was HUGE but could have used a little more salt on the top and a little less on the bottom (suggesting that it sat f or a while?) but overall - the food here was fantastic.We had a big party, split the tables and the other side had food coming all night long. We opted for a bit more conservative approach, ordering a big tray of about 5 rolls (including the Bostonian[?] - which was FANTASTIC). There really wasn't anything there that wasn't really quite delicious.Try the Kiss of Fire - but I have to warn you, there's a fuse on that fire. It hits you about your third piece in...The service was great. We ran that poor girl's legs completely off. But again, order a Diet Coke and you'll get is Diet Pepsi ok?. My typical response is, well, is paying in Chinese Yen ok?... you get the idea.All in all, good friends, good times, good sushi. A solid 4.

The wait during lunch is tolerable; which is a rare find during the lunch hour....however, me and several of my devoted co-workers would appreciate if the full menu was served before 3 PM. There have been multiple occasions during which this location has lost service due to the lack of full menu during working hours. The tatted bartender has been incredibly welcoming and apologetic during (lack of lunch service) and at these times. He should be recognized for his great efforts for maintaining service at this establishment.

I've tried several of their unique margaritas, which sound fun but taste awful.  I had the watermelon one last night and couldn't take more than 2 sips because it was so sour.Stick with their beer or saki.

The food was so bad and expensive.  Bad food that cost a lot leaves you feeling more than a little ripped off.  The drink menu does not have prices,  this is because a glass of wine is 10 dollars.  The $23 Lechon Asado could have been mistaken for bad jerky.  There are NOW much better Cuban here in Austin, let this one fade away.

I finally decided based on how high it's rated.  Since it has almost five stars, I'm rounding down to two.I'm going to try to be (for me) brief.  Food & drink:  Very meh.  Interesting, in a what? kind of way.  But I've pretty much forgotten what I  had.  The wife had a waffle... for the price it should have been orgasmic, it was not in the top 50% of her waffle experiences.  My beverage was a Matcha Latte (had to go to website to remember) it was ok, but for that interesting a drink it should have been more interesting.  Maybe it was the day we ordered.Hmm,  I just went and looked at the photos section of the Yelp listing.  I don't know if it means anything on how the place was doing that day, but my latte did not have any cute art on top.  Maybe it WAS an off day.  Or maybe they didn't like us :OService...  Ok, friendly, but disorganized.  It was fairly busy, but they had lots of staff.The building and how they used it was great!  Nice and quirky.  That is what moved me to consider 3 stars.  The windows in the bathroom doors did take me back to my time in Europe (not really my favorite feature of Europe, but hey, nostalgia!).  The back dining area was worth wandering back to take a look at.Bottom line:  If I had waited in line more than 4 minutes to get in I'd feel really bad.  As is, I can't recommend it, but if you try it and like it, maybe I'm missing something.

It's so good I just can't keep away! All of the pizzas are out of this world from the classic Margherita to The Farmers Market which is a pesto masterpiece topped with folded zucchini, chopped asparagus and snow peas and finished with a soft egg! My favorites though are the Sopressato and the Mushroom. The salads are delicious as well and very beautiful! My favorite appetizer is the Burrata Caprese which I think is best in town. I haven't tried any of the entrees or deserts yet but I may need to because I have yet to be disappointed.

I've been coming to Brasserie for a few years now, and have had the chance to visit for brunch, lunch and dinner (and have enjoyed several of their desserts as well!). When my family visit, especially if it's for a special occasion, this is our go-to place to celebrate. Their bloody mary's in the morning go great with all of their brunch items: from the Simple Salad, to the Bordeaux Scramble and beyond. My husband goes crazy for the Croque Madame - he's had it at other places in Vegas and even Paris, and still feels they couldn't touch the one served here! All of their salads, les frites, les moules au pistou, le saumon, I could go on and on. I've never been disappointed here - everything is absolutely delicious. Their daily specials are always a delight as well! Don't forget to try one of their cocktails or have a glass of wine off of their great list. Bon appetit!

I wanted a place that played good music - not so loud that your head hurt and your vocal cords strained - an outdoor seating area, and obviously well priced, generous drinks. After I went to Mohawk the first time a few weeks back (to watch Yann Tiersen play!) I haven't stopped raving about the place. It's my new favorite bar in Austin and it definitely exceeded my expectations. There're three decks outside, equipped with an outdoor bar to keep traffic from building up at the indoor bar, which is brilliant for show nights when it gets crowded. I definitely plan to make regular visits down there now that summer vacation's begun!

Delicious bacon, and the banana pancakes are awesome too. It's a great go-to breakfast/brunch joint with the kind of atmosphere you appreciate on a very lazy Sunday morning. Simple, straight forward breakfast option for anyone who lives in the area. I'll be back.

I came here on a Wednesday for a drink with some friends.  The hostess and server were both quite nice and service overall was spot on (checked in on just often enough).  The drinks were creative and got some good reviews and my scotch was neat!

Our destination of choice?  Ma Soba, a pan-Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill.  Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards.  Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out.We were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening.  Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had decided what we wanted.  She took our order and left.  Not that she didn't do her job well; she was tremendously efficient.  Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly.  But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable.We hit a home run with our appetizers.  My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside.  My miso soup was excellent.  For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll.  Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston.  It's not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi.  With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality.  We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile.  However, the biggest disappointment was yet to come.  We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend's fork made a resounding clank against  it as he tried to cut into it.  I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back.  We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub-standard fare.We left disappointed.  The sushi itself was as expected, but the service, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied.  I doubt we'll go back.

Coffee was perked...and tasty. Breakfast was very good. Had standard... eggs, bacon, hash browns and French toast.  With coffee, still less than $10.  Staff was attentive even though they were busy.  Coffee never ran out on me.  My friend had the eggs Benedict. Well done, particularly for a diner. Hollandaise was homemade...not Sysco.  Looking forward to going back.If u are at a swim meet at Harvard U...park the car and walk here...5 minutes away.

Just moved in across the street and was excited to have a juice bar across so close! Went in the first day to be greeted by a young woman with the worst attitude ever. I felt like I was doing her a disservice by asking her to do her job. Went in the day after hoping she wouldn't be working because the food was quite good, only to find another young woman with an equally if not worse attitude working. Whoever owns or runs this establishment needs to find people who don't suck life out of the room to represent their business. I would rather pay someone to go and get me a smoothie than go in myself.

The rooms are spacious,  the only negative is that their hallways are not decorated.  Makes it feel not fancy as the rest of the place.

The staff is always friendly and ready to assist however they can. The food is the real star of this place. I've thoroughly enjoyed the Lamb burger and the ribs so if you'd like some great flavor start there.

Spot on chicken deliciousness. It (dare I say it?) may be better than Lucy's. (Shhh don't tell on me!).

We were here on a Friday night and were surprised to find people literally dancing on their tables with a DJ playing a mix of dance music and what I imagine was Greek pop music. The atmosphere was very loud but overall the food was great and the service was excellent. Worth checking out!

When you go to one you know you will get a consistently good experience. Their summer dine around program is ingenious. Great marketing - give the person who thought of it a raise. It keeps me in their restaurants once a month and I spend a lot of $$$$ each time. At kyma we started with the grilled octopus and all the reviews are true - it's awesome. So tender. Calamari was good too but grilled octopus is still my favorite. For dinner I had the sea bream. Excellent. With white bean salad (I recommend). Eggplant side was also great. For dessert I had the chocolate lava cake with warm sauce inside. If you love chocolate, get this. It was great. I had the 'nut' ice cream. Forgot exact name. It was just ok. My friends ice cream was creamier and better. The nuts made it too lumpy. Wasn't too bad - I still ate it. Hehe

I sat at the bar both times and the bartender gave me attitude when I complained that the menu was so limited.  She wasn't friendly at all and actually only served me after I had to flag her down (even though there were only four people at the bar at the time - she was too busy doing prep work and playing on her phone).  Coincidentally, it was the same bartender on both visits.  By the way, I went in the second time because it was six months in between visits and I forgot that they only had a limited menu after 2pm.  I should have remembered after the first visit, so the second visit was a mistake and only served to confirm my opinion of so-so food and lousy service.

The noodles are made in house and are so delicious! $7.95 special for lunch and you get a huge bowl of noodles. Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed!

I haven't eaten at the tourist I-Drive location, but I've heard it sucks compared to the Lake Mary location.  Everything here is excellent and it had some of the freshest seafood available.  The sushi is pretty awesome, but I definitely suggest trying their oyster sampler appetizer.  My favorite entree is the seared Ahi tuna.  But definitely check out their daily specials.  Sometimes they get in gigantic stone crab claws.The wine selection is great and they poor stiff drinks.  Always a plus.The food is pricey but it's excellent as well as the service. The decor is great too.  My favorite is the outdoor patio and the bar that's plastered with oyster shells.

We got seated quickly but even getting waitress to come by was difficult. Had two hungry kids waiting. Messed up drink order. And messed up food order. Staff may be overworked and our waitress in particular did not seem well versed in the menu. As far as food is concerned. Cheese enchiladas tasted like kraft American cheese slices. Veggie-changa was too breadth and didn't have much flavor. Chips were ok. Margaritas were way too sweet. Would not go again.

We told the server we were on lunch break and we come from a company that is right down the road that always orders there so they usually work well with us and get us in and out in a timely manner....but not today! They were incredibly rude and put our order in late, like 15 minutes after we ordered. Then we asked where our food was and that we needed to leave soon, and the waitress said well if you need to leave you need to leave. I will get to go boxes. We were in shock. We asked for the owners and they weren't in, so we ffigure that's why the staff was so terrible today, but my group and I decided to never go back there. So if you go and are served by a young girl that dresses like she's going to a soccer match, run the other direction and eat somewhere else! We ended up taking our food in TO GO boxes and ate at work. Now we're telling our whole company of over 4,000 employees to stay away from it!

I worked at a chilis for many years so I understand the food quality and what to expect from a place like this. I'm not sure if this location is a franchise or not, but it was just horrible. From the service to the food presentation to the taste, just ew! I always order a margarita, queso dip and a quesadilla explosion salad. Being that this is always my order, I've come to know what to expect, but this meal almost seemed like it was someone trying to replicate (unsuccessfully) the chilis' recipes. The queso dip was like warm and thick. The consistency was grainy instead of creamy and it just didn't taste good. The quesadilla salad was thrown onto the place and looked like someone had bumped the plate or almost dropped it or something. The chicken was thick and rubbery. I know this place is in tourist central so maybe they don't have to pay much attention to quality on account that people will come regardless because they won't know, but we definitely won't be back here! The chilis on I-drive is much more consistent! It's a little more of a drive, but it's worth it.

Poutine is one of my all time favorite foods and this is the best I have had in Boston. They have a decent beer selection as well. Only complaint would have been the poutine could have used a little more gravy, was dry once I got to the bottom.

We've found a few places here and there ... a place in San Francisco (which has since closed down) and a good place in Miami - but we had pretty much given up hope around here.  Enter (of all places...) Que Padre.  When I first told him that it opened and that they had bolivian food he laughed because he thought I was kidding (A Mexican place.... reallyy??).... But we went and met the owner and then downed a good 7-9 beef saltenas hot and fresh out of the oven.  I'm no expert - but I think they're the best ones I've ever had... but the honey was so happy... and for that alone - we will be back many many more times.  Perfect crust.  So hot and juicy.  A little hot sauce... and magic happens.  :)

(I did finally have to admit I don't care for quinoa after this visit but it was of no fault of the restaurant.)Each time I've been in the staff and been very friendly and helpful.I try to make it here at least once a month.

I eat out 3-4 times a week and I came to this location very often. Unfortunately, they used to have a great menu but most of that is gone and even though the staff are great, the food has gotten consistently worse and worse. I had three bad meals here in a row before I finally decided to pack it in and say good bye. It doesn't matter what you order, the quality of the ingredients has gotten worse and the kitchen staff seemingly doesn't care. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to mention other restaurants, but there's another chain restaurant a block away that has been improving their menu recently and they've earned my loyalty now. It's a shame though because I often recommended Milestones to other people and now I'm forced to do the exact opposite.

The actual food was well prepared and tasty, but really,two small fish tacos with no accoutrements is an entree in Austin?  My husband's entree was a piece of chicken.  Period.  Sides are separate.  Now, quality was good, but if I hadn't had peanuts before we went, I'd have left hungry. I also thought the menu was limited.

I came here for a conference in July and found that with all the wings in this hotel it can be very confusing to get around and get lost. Also there was a dance competition going on at the same time that seemed to bleed into our area.The food supplied at lunches and dinner was good every time, no real complaints. A little better than standard hotel conference food- however one of my roommates for the conference was a vegetarian and she was not happy with the tofu option that was provided at EVERY meal.Next, I found the pool to not have very much space to accommodate enough people at all. We went outside at 1pm and found not one single spot to sit. This would dissuade me from coming back to this hotel.The food in the restaurants was very expensive, hard to find  quick cheap lunch in our off time. Additionally, the bar they had open at night by the entrance to the hotel was VERY expensive for a drink. I am talking 13-17$ per drink. No thank you.Lastly, my biggest issue was the bathroom in our hotel room. It was great and all that a TV was in the mirror- not gonna lie, that was COOL. However, there were slots in the bathroom door so there was no real privacy at all. It was like the slots on a closet door? I was rooming with some people that I was not as familiar with and I was turned off by this- especially for how expensive it is to stay here! I later learned that not all the rooms were like this, only on our wing.

It seems like a good portion for the money which you would expect from Mexican, but isn't always the case in Austin.  We like the Burritos and the Fish Tacos.  While you are there, you definitely need to try the Bulldog which is essentially a Margarita topped off with Corona.  If you are looking for an inexpensive good meal while in SOCO, this is good place to visit.

The ambiance, decor, beer and even service could be at its bottom and I would still drive through a Zombie Apocalypse to get here. However, everything is at epic proportions. Why is there not a line out the door at all times? I thank everyone's hard work in making this one of my favourite restaurants I have been to.

Fortunately a friend was still on the way, and accepted our telephoned request to please pick up some food on her way over.Marvel's Lunch Box accepts credit cards, which was great since I figured our friend would not have enough cash on hand to pay for our order.When she arrived with two bags in hand, we took account, and discovered that the fried clams were sadly MIA.  She headed right back, got the clams, an apology, and a two courtesy bowls of soups for our trouble.For herself, she got the Crab Roll $13.95 - Sweet lump and back fin meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll / includes coleslaw.The portion of meat was okay, and the meat fresh, but she felt the bread to meat ratio was just too high and the bun quite filling.The rest of us shared two ¼ Lb Lobster Roll $18.95 (Made to order, select claw and knuckle meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll / includes coleslaw.), the Pint Ipswich Clams $17.95 (Sweet small-bellied clams prepared in our house batter / includes tartar sauce and lemon.) and a large order of Onion Rings $5.50.I liked the onion rings because the crisp batter enclosed thick rings of onions, and the whole fried clams had a satisfying crispness as well, though they were not the best of the season for me, as that accolade went to a spot up in Maine and has yet to be dethroned.  The lobster roll was too light on the lobster for the price, but the beautiful brioche roll was generously buttered and toasted quite well.  Too much grease for the health conscious, but go big or go home!We enjoyed the clam chowder - both the surprise and the taste of it - and were pleased to find corn kernels amidst the clams and the potato cubes.  The other soup looked like minestrone till we discovered a slice of kielbasa here and an oyster there.  Good, but my preference was towards the chowder.Though we ordered 4 items, they gave us 5 cole slaws so we could each have one, and we shared the 3 tartar sauces, which was plenty for the job.  They were generous with wet naps and packaged salt and pepper, and we had enough utensils.3.5 stars, rounded up for their making amends.They are open daily, and close at 8pm.

Both were very delicious. The dessert was the banana foster which was outstanding.  Our sides were spinach and broccoli which was ok. Hard to give 5 stars but really great.

No people screaming from the back which made our dine in experience even better. The food was delicious and the prices were favorable. I would definitely recommend the sesame chicken and orange chicken when they have it.The inside of the restraunt was very calm, well lit and clean. Give these guys a visit.

I have no doubt if he or someone with a similar skill set was in the kitchen, Flip Burger would be 5 stars.  You are giving 5 star ingredients to a burger flipper, which isn't quite going to cut it.We started off with the poutine appetizer.  Poutine is popping up everywhere lately.  This version was underwhelming.  There really wasn't any meat in this dish.  The fries are cooked in beef fat and the gravy is chorizo based, but I couldn't find much chorizo in it.  It should also have cheese curds, but those were absent as well.  What we had here was a savory creamy sauce poured over french fries, topped with two fried eggs.  Unfortunately the egg whites were still runny, which I'm not a fan of.  It's amazing that it's so hard for a cook to get the yolks runny and the whites cooked.  There was plenty of fries so my buddy and I kind of just left the ones that were touched by the clear uncooked egg white.  2 stars  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=nxZc_vqqUeAxzWFcWMhzXQI was very excited to try a Milkshake here, specifically the Krispy Kreme shake.  I don't know if they blend up an whole Krispy Kreme glazed donut in there, but it sure tasted exactly like drinking one.  It was delicious.  My only disappointment was at the use of the liquid nitrogen.  Of course if you've watched Richard Blais on Top Chef, you know he enjoys using it.  So these shakes have Liquid Nitrogen added to them.  Unfortunately this molecular gastronomy technique was left to our server/ hostess.  It consisted of her pouring a little bit of liquid nitrogen over the top of the milkshake, which made it smoke a little bit.  This can't be what Blais intends here, as it added nothing but a little flair.  I've had ice cream blasted with liquid nitrogen before and it's usually used to get a crunchy outer shell, which would have offered an interesting texture.  It also can be added to the process of making ice cream which lends itself to smaller crystals, thus giving it a smoother texture.  This was a pretty smooth creamy shake, so perhaps that's what's going on here.  The top of my shake that had the liquid nitrogen poured on it was a goopy mess.  4 stars  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=V7XgrE_YOV-BkIJe2xLdXgAs for the burger, I went with the Earth & Turf Burger.  This patty is a blend of ground beef and ground mushrooms, and I loved the blend.  It was topped with caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, gruyere cheese, pickles, and a delicious mushroom mayo.  Lots of little chopped up pieces of mushrooms were mixed in with the mayo.  If you love mushrooms, this is your burger.  I ordered it medium rare.  From the first bite, I thought this is a 5 star burger and outstanding.  Unfortunately the burger flipper, didn't give me a medium rare burger, or even a medium burger.  It was closer to medium well, and fully cooked all the way through.  Now the quality of the beef saved it.  It was still very juicy and I enjoyed every bite.  However, the burger flipper's job is to do one thing, and that's pretty much cook a burger correctly.  A real chef wouldn't have messed that up.  Even still I'm giving this burger 4.5 stars.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=YAVwD_oolsY8kSVS4LAnhQMy buddy also enjoyed his burger, but it was also medium well, rather than the medium rare he ordered.  We were the first diners of the day and ours were the only burgers the cook had to pay attention to, so it's not like he lost track of them.  Oh well, that's the problem with a chain style restaurant where the Top Chef is absent.  And lack of execution keeps Flip Burger from getting 5 stars from me.  But I'll be happy to eat that over cooked mushroom burger anytime.*Also of note, they say they are open until 11pm, but we were turned away at 10:45 pm, which we weren't too happy about.  If you don't want to take customers up until your closing time, then change your closing time to when you do want to take them.  10:30 or whatever.  But to turn someone away while you are technically still open, only ticks off the customer.  We almost didn't return the next day after being treated like that.  Most people wouldn't have.

The basic pancake order was so large, if I had eaten just half, would killed me. The service was good, but not the friendliest. Worth another visit when not so busy. 5 days ago...Saturday.

The prices are great and the portions are intense. Always busy, but never the ridiculous waits you get for popular breakfast places in Portland.

However, the service leaves something to be desired.  My partner and I walked into the bar on a slow afternoon at the beginning of June.  My partner asked the bartender what seasonal beers they have on tap (he was looking for a summer ale).  The bartender looks at the beer menu on the wall and says, All the beers are listed there.  Everything is seasonal.  Then he walked away and started talking to a coworker and stocking the bar before we even had a chance to respond.  Rude.  The bartender continued to have an I could care less cocky attitude when he finally took our order and when we closed out.Alberta doesn't need this kind of douche-baggery.  There are so many friendly bars to go to, I don't know that we'll be returning to ASP.

I eventually went for the awesome looking brunch menu and ordered way too much for two people:- Pulled Pork Corn Muffin ($6)This is listed under sides, but it came out first and was a really delicious start to the meal. It's less like a corn muffin, and more like just a ton of pork with some guacamole on delicious bread.- Sunrise Poutine ($15)I told myself that this was a starter, so I wouldn't feel horrendous for ordering three entrees. This is way more than an appetizer and is a meal on its own. This consists of a hot pile of fries covered in scrambled eggs, gravy, cheese curds and Canadian bacon. I often regret ordering poutine when I'm left with half a plate of pure mush and sogginess, but that was not the case here at all - this was some of the best poutine I've ever had, as the fries remained super crispy throughout and were incredibly good combined with the salty Canadian bacon and the fluffy eggs.- Sunnyside Burger ($15)As if we didn't get enough bacon, egg and cheese with the poutine, we also had this excellent burger with plenty more of the same piled on top of it. This was a really outstanding burger. The sunnyside egg on top was nice and runny and was just perfect with the bacon and American cheese.- Southern Belle French Toast ($12)Another really excellent choice, this french toast came with two huge, juicy chicken breasts on top of it. The jalapeno jelly was a little strange, but aside from that, the chicken and french toast combo was just as good, if not better than the standard chicken and waffles.It's a pretty hipstery crowd with hipstery, slightly lazy service. It's a fun, energetic atmosphere though, which combined with all that delicious  food makes you look past these slight flaws and yearn to return to try more great stuff.

It is all depending on what you order.  I used to be a big fan of their Chirashi.  If you read few reviews, they used fresh grated wasabi, it should have seaweed, octopus salad, real crab meat, tobiko, avocado along with fresh sashimi in a bowl of rice for only $17.  I can tell you that the Chirashi is no longer the same.  In my last 4 attempts, their Chirashi is pretty disappointing.  Very small slices of tuna (3 pcs), salmon (2 pcs), katsuo (2 pcs), saba (2 pcs) and Hamachi (2 pcs).  They did not put any seafood salad nor avocado.  Few pcs of spoiled cabbages and very little amount of rice.  I was hungry again after 2 hours, I probably would re-thinking about going there.  Yes, they do have a lot of cooked sushi option, their service is excellent.  So sad that I have to find another sushi restaurant.  I really wanted our relationships last a little longer.

Like the one at Emmer and Rye.Very good service and they selected a good wine to go with the food.Food - We stayed away from mammal food and decided on veggies and seafood.- Potato Puffs were as good as advertised- Anything on the open fire wood grill is solid - we had Broccolini and Shrimp- Risotto was the starThey have Valet parking and the company which they outsource to is top notch.  Very professional.Only draw back was the dessert which was just ok compared to the rest.Tip - make reservations - the room is not very big and the bar is reserved as well for seating for dinner - when we went it was a three hour wait to eat at the bar.  You also cannot walk up and order a drink at the bar since it is reserved for seating.

Have now been there twice, first time for beer and apps, second time with coworkers for a full dinner and beers.The beers are beyond good, their IPA is fantastic and one of the best IPAs around. First time I was there, they had Bodhi, and Bodhi is my favorite IPA...period. Also, they have a great selection of guest taps, which it seems they are very picky about, and they pull together some great other Ohio brews.Ordered the Beer battered Asparagus as an appetizer, and Buffalo BBQ Chicken sandwich with garlic fries and extra side of fried plantains. Well, it was all absolutely fantastic. The appetizer was very enjoyable, my only complaint is that the asparagus would pull out of the breading fairly easily. The sandwich was absolutely perfect, the fries were amazing and the fried plantains were just icing on the cake. I think I will be ordering this combo again and again. This restaurant surprised me greatly and will be returning soon.

Coupled with a nice patio and a decent view of the water, I deemed Hurricane Grill a solid B. On my second visit, the West Coast benny I was served literally tasted and smelled like garbage. Maybe the avocado was overripe, maybe the fish not so fresh anymore, I'm not sure, I'm not a scientist. I didn't complain as there were 8 of us and I really didn't want to cause a scene. The coffee was weak and bland and definitely not very fresh. Service was good though; we arrived late and the server promptly took orders and filled waters. Overall, food is lacking but location and service deem this place a-okay.

Generous size and delicious with extra sauce. For take out for a nice treat it is fast and easy. I don't eat meat but my friend loves their steak bomb sub. Every town needs a reliable Italian shop like this.

I found the spring rolls to be average, as well as the pho. The broth was okay, but I didn't find there to be a balance between the noodles and meat. The meat was another issue I had and is the reason I won't be returning. I love chicken pho - well when the meat is tender and juicy. Both times that I can recall ordering chicken pho here  the meat was really dry and almost resembled the texture of beef jerky. Although my boyfriend likes this place I never want to return.

About 1 inch long, 18 were $20.  I thought they were joking.  The ones pictured on someone else's review is what I was expecting.   What I got were 3 times smaller.  So tiny they were difficult to get the shrimp out of the very sticky, grippy shell.   Not worth the money even if it were $7 as a delicacy appetizer.   Get a fish, but expect it to be small.   Fortunately the visit with my old pal was worth the trip anyway.  Service was good.

The staff is great, there aren't any attitudes, and they have a good mix of regulars and first timers that are sure to come back.It's pretty big, which is great for groups and on busy nights.  There's a large patio out back, and a little nook full of couches inside.  Good beer selection, great prices.

I enjoyed the chicken the most. It was just the right amount of crispiness. I liked the bun too, but I'm not sure about everything else in it. I ordered two of the regular fried and it ended up to be so much. Typically that would be a good thing...except it was probably one of the saltiest fries I have eaten. You have to drench it in ketchup.

I normally just get the fried shrimp but she gets the shrimp/crab legs combos and has never been disappointed. We have only had take out but my daughter says everyone has been nice to her each time she has gone. The only reason I didn't give it more stars is because it has to be the best food ever for me to give it more than 3 stars.

The later it gets, the smokier it gets, and you'll never go home in a condition that allows you the privilege of smelling your own perfume/cologne, but in the summer months this can be a saving grace.  No patio = less hipsters invading, just a bunch of neighborhood guys and gals out for a low key evening with a couple of pints.Did I mention I love this damn place?

I got some sort of steak sandwich with mushrooms and onions.  First of all, for $18, there wasn't much steak which was very disappointing.   I cant say if it was cooked to order or not since there was so little meat.   There were certainly more mushrooms and onions than meat.   Also, the bread was very crusty.   Too crusty.   The dish also came with french fries which were very greasy.  Only half were edible.  The rest seemed soaked in oil and were droopy.   Overall, not a great meal.   I certainly would not go back given the price.  I can think of a number of places that are much better.  Capital grill has an amazing steak sandwich (with two to three times as much meat) at the same price point.   OR go to Servitzios down the street for much less he money and a better sandwich.

The restaurant is on the lobby level and features space for a couple hundred restaurant guests and a FANTASTIC 40-person bar with small side rooms off the main bar that are cool, blue, hip and excellent.The biggest key unique selling point here is the menu and the amazing food.  The food was based on a background of restaurants in the pacific northwest for inspiration.  In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal food with huge flavor frequent organic influences...and the like.  Yes...I am writing this about the food at a major restaurant inside one of the icons of Walt Disney World.  This place is a massive departure from what you would expect.  No fries, no fried food.  But don't think it's all healthy in a dull way.  There's an amazing pork tenderloin, freshly crafted creamy soups, excellent desserts, and...for my money...the single best margarita I have ever consumed.The fresh fish with edamame salsa and the citrus and avocado salad made me come back for a second visit.I ate there 4 times in a week at Disney.  Not only is the food wonderful and the bar very attainable for dinner seating, but the prices are especially fair in the theme park context. They'd be fair in any context, in any city, on any block.This place is a serious contender for best food at WDW in my 8 day stay.

Breading on the fish was super thin and tasteless. The fish itself was thin and a rubbery. The shrimp were severely overcooked. The slaw was nothing more than shredded cabbage with dressing and some type of seeds in it. Not sure what they were but there was way too much and they had a bitter taste. I like my fish and chips to be thick and flakey. This was about 1/4 inch thick and 3 inches wide. Might make a good sandwich if the breading had some seasoning, they weren't over cooked, and u layered them. Not even sure what fish I ended up with because they were out of so many items. I think it was the swai (catfish) and something else. If u plan on going, call ahead to see what they are out of. As other reviewers have noted, the fries were very good. I would come again JUST for the fries. Overall though, it was a disappointment. Not bad enough to complain about and send back, but almost. Sorry to be so harsh...

But whoever they are hiring now, both at this location and the one on Williams are racist racist racist. I've watched myself be charged for things I never was before, even watching others not be charged the same. Literally watched the quote unquote bowler give me less, noticeably. And when my sisters have patronized the NE location the service was despicable hesitabt and racist. Even found hair in the food.... given the service who knows if it was purposeful or not.  Yuck. I will not be coming back... and this was a fave. Just appalled

Definitely one of the best in the Boston area! delivery took about an hour which is pretty standard for most places in my area. Looking forward to trying more of their dishes!

OK, I didn't REALLY expect to see any of them......but I would have liked the bartender to be a little bit nicer though.  She was obviously bothered that she had another customer - not that there were very many to begin with.  Decent beer selection, and decent basic menu (as I expected).  My burger was cooked the way I ordered it.......thing is, there was nothing special at all about it.  A five guys burger is tastier, and a whole lot cheaper.  The onion strings were good, but again - not great.  The special Whalburger sauce that came with it (thousand island) was good.....helped to give the burger some taste.  So, that's that.......I'll check the place out again if Marky Mark will buy me a beer.  I've got a hell of a movie pitch for him!

We had a Vieux Carre and it was so good we had two! I had the French kiss pizza the first time. It was very good. But the best meal was definitely the meatloaf mountain. I can't say enough about this dish. It was delicious. The meatloaf was tender and juicy, the mashed potatoes were so flavorful and the mushroom gravy and fried onions only made it better. The service was amazing as well. It felt like we were waited on by every server in the house. If one of them walked by and thought we needed something, they stopped and took care of us. Definitely felt the love and highly recommend this one.

I love the  light filled room the relaxed atmosphere, the Coffee, the cocktails, the pastries and the people who work there. After 6 the no laptop rule on the bar is great as it gives some room to sit and drink great cocktails.  Plus I hate to worry I am going to knock someone's books, laptop and ruin their whole life. I recommend the flat white, rooibos tea, and all the pastries!

I was very happy to hear they have both drink and food specials including a ladies night on Thursday.  The food and wait staff was great, i tried the tuna flat bread.  Everything seemed very fresh.  I will definitely be back.  I do see the trouble with noise on real busy nights, but i wasn't effected while on my visit.

On a Friday mid morning I walked into this cozy restaurant that's owned and managed by Theo and his wife. What made this place special were the regulars who greeted each other by name from 3 year olds to 70 year olds. In addition to Italian, there were other languages spoken by patrons as well.I gave Theo's 4 stars mainly for how welcoming and down to earth it is. The waffle with strawberries were pretty in appearance but a bit rubbery. Other customers had combos with eggs and they looked like better choices.

Easy to find parking and the place is for a quick bite to eat so don't set yourself with high expectations it's a Michelin Award restaurant.  My fave things that set out from all the burger joints popping up are the tater tots (regular or sweet potato) and the homemade buns (not THE Actual Wahlberg buns).Simple setup inside with hints of Dorchester and all the famous Wahlberg Movies and photos to make it a la Planet Hollywood.  To the left, a full service restaurant and then to the right, quick take out.  Simple layout of a menu, choose your meat, toppings and side.  I had the BBQ Bacon Burger Turkey style - hellz yeah it was delicious!  Jalapenos and bbq sauce dripping from the homemade potato bread like bun.  then who doesn't love crispy bacon and to make yourself feel better about your health, a nice thick cut of avocado.  It was good and set my expectations.Then the tater tots - crispy and salty but you do get a small size.  I would go here again if I'm in the area and everyone has to try it once to reduce your stalking obsession over the brothers :)

They were buttery and flavorful! The blood orange margarita was DELICIOUS. I have been very disappointed with almost all Disney dining options, but flying fish was well worth the trip to the boardwalk.

They would have these looks of they feel sorry for me on their faces. I wouldn't think anything of it. But last nite. My life was changed.  This is the diriest crazy good. Keep talking about how good it is while you eat it. Wish you had more room cause u greedy and you want more good pizza !!! Are they slow? Its not so much slow as this pizza takes a while to cook. But nobody is really hustling  in the joint. But man. Who cares...the pizza was worth it! Get some of the siracha candied bacon. Personally I feel like they should give you more for 2.99...but hey its tasty!!!

We both got mimosas, I got the migas (with a side of bacon) and she got the traditional eggs Benedict and gumpo soup for an appetizer. Everything was so tasty, even right down to the little cornbread they serve at the beginning. The waiters were extremely nice. In fact, we were about to forget our things we bought at Uncommon Objects and one of the waiters was quick to tell us we almost forget our bags! The wait was 45 minutes long but it was a Sunday on South Congress at 1:30 PM so it's understandable. The prices weren't bad and the portions were pretty big, so we'd definitely come back again.

CJ has a robust an diverse menu with reasonably priced entrees.  CJ also has sports on TVs visible from the dining area without feeling like you are eating at a sports bar.  They accommodate children unlike any place we have dined by offering complimentary meals for toddlers.  A pleasant dining experience!

It offers a convenient spot not only for its patrons, but also passers-by who walk around the Mall and in fact some walk by the opposing balcony by the escalator where there is clear view of the huge wall projector screen, therefore, a perfect viewing angle from EVERY angle during a game.  Also good for hotel guests, train commuters who cut through the mall to catch the Orange Line, etc.  Champions had been renovated a few years back and their bar especially offers colorful and vibe and atmosphere to their patrons.  The several TVs, their wall projector add to the excitement during a game.  Their food is mediocre, but the food presentation was beautiful.  Staff was courteous but service not prompt enough.  Overall, I like this bar and will return.

We had asked the hostess if we could site outside on the patio. No problems there. We had ordered 2 Pop (soda), which ended up costing $4, which we thought was expensive. For an appetizer, we ordered the crab cakes. My mom really enjoyed it- says it was made with lots of crab. My mom ordered the baby back ribs and I had ordered the prawn linguine. The entrees were pretty tasty. I enjoyed what I ordered. I ate the entire thing. For dessert, we ordered the lava cake. It came with some ice cream and some dabs of sauces on the side. Our server was nice, but pretty slow. I had even heard a few people ask the blonde server to get their bill because they had no idea where their server was. Next time, we will skip the pop and stick to water. The restaurant was not busy, so it was a little disappointing that the service was so slow. Decent food, good location.

If this was my neighborhood I would be a regular.  The sushi was great.  Fresh fish, good rice, and excellent miso.  The service was good.   Pricing was good.  We ordered three rolls. miso, and edamame for $24.    Also liked they had some rolls out of the ordinary rather than the typical combos that you find at many places.A few notes having read some other reviews....One review talks about the fish being frozen, he must not know much about sushi fish as all sushi fish is frozen as a way to kill any parasites the fish might have.  Size,  the place is small.  There are only 7 seats at the sushi bar and one table.  On a Thruseday evening at 7:30 not a problem.   Additional options is you can order sushi at Roscoes bar next door.  Roscoes provides the liquor service for the Miyamoto sushi.  So if the place is full simply sit next door.Definitely worth checking out.

Fries were like PTerrys but less greasy. Croissant bites were overcooked and not very sweet.  The best thing was the fresh lemonade and the Honey Dijon sauce was one of the best I've ever tasted. Great ice tea!  Most places are pretty bad.

Two of these and you'll be feelin' fine! The food was delicious, but the portions are rather tiny and not very filling. Their mac and cheese, and their pork and the fried chicken tacos, were very good. Good place for drinks and an appetizer of two, can't say I'd recommend it for a while dinner unless you're willing to spend some major cash!

Then we still had to pay for it. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse their prices were different on the bill then when it said on the menu. Overall if you read this far it was pretty bad.

Strong and spicy!As for the brunch we had the omelette, frittata and Caesar salad ( with limoncello vinegarette). The lemon dressing was awesome. Portions were big and good solid flavors. Pretty good value for the area with quantity and quality.

The servers were quite cold, snatching the menu away from our hands. It wasn't as if it was full of people waiting to be served. But the pho was good enough to ease my feelings, and it was served quite quickly as well. But then, when we were paying, the cashier was again very rude, snatching the money away and slamming it on the counter. We were quite startled and it left a bad aftertaste that erased the good mood. I'd recommend the place if you're just looking for decent pho for a cheap price, but if you want and overall pleasant experience, you might want to try somewhere else.

We had the calamari, chicken croquette, patatas bravas, montaditos, and grilled peach salad along with queso and cured meat to start. The peach wasn't in season but that is my only complaint. Cocktails were tasty as well. I recommend the lemongrass Collins. Service was very attentive and pricing was totally reasonable for the quality.
