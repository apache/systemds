# This script aims to provide a snippet of a common usecase for our deep learning algorithms.

# Imports
source("nn/layers/conv2d_builtin.dml") as conv2d
source("nn/layers/max_pool2d_builtin.dml") as max_pool2d

# Hyperparameters & Settings
batch_size = 32
num_batches = 2

# Generate dummy input data
N = batch_size * num_batches  # num examples
C = 3  # num input channels
Hin = 224  # input height
Win = 224  # input width
X = rand(rows=N, cols=C*Hin*Win, pdf="normal")

# Create network:
Hf = 3  # filter height
Wf = 3  # filter width
stride = 1
pad = 1  # For same dimensions, (Hf - stride) / 2
F1 = 32  # num conv filters in conv1
[Wc1, bc1] = conv2d::init(F1, C, Hf, Wf)  # inputs: (N, C*Hin*Win)

# Create data structure to store gradients computed in parallel
doutc1_agg = matrix(0, rows=num_batches, cols=batch_size*F1*Hin*Win)
dWc1_agg = matrix(0, rows=num_batches, cols=nrow(Wc1)*ncol(Wc1))

# Imagine that a loop over mini-batches would go here, but for this test, we will
# hardcode to the first iteration.
j = 1
if (1==1) {print("HI")}  # cut DAG!

# Get a mini-batch in this group
beg = ((j-1) * batch_size) + 1
end = beg + batch_size - 1
X_batch = X[beg:end,]

# Note: This causes Spark execution, unless constant folding + IPA second chance compilation is
# enabled, due to the Houtc1 & Woutc1 DAGs being unevaluated, and thus the size of downstream nodes
# in the graph that use Houtc1 & Woutc1 becoming unknown.  From a mathematical standpoint, those
# DAGs can be computed during initial compilation since they are dependent only on scalar arguments
# passed into conv2d::forward.  However, the initial constant folding (static rewrite) pass can't
# replace the following Houtc1 & Woutc1 due to them being dependent on transient reads of the
# arguments passed into conv2d::forward.  Once IPA runs, those transient reads will be replaced with
# scalars due to the IPA scalar replacement. Once that is complete, a second pass of constant
# folding (static rewrite) can evaluate Houtc1 & Woutc1 to literals.  Given that, a subsequent
# second pass of IPA can make use of those literals during size propagation, thus allowing
# downstream ops to have known sizes. Overall, with a second pass of static rewrites +
# IPA, all sizes in this script can be known during initial compilation, and thus no Spark
# instructions will be compiled or run.  On the contrary, without that second pass, these sizes
# will remain unknown even during recompilation.
