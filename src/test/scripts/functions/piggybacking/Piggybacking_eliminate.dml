# Script to reproduce a piggybacking bug related to "eliminated" group lops.
# The bug appears only when MMultMethod=CPMM was chosen (or forced) for the 
# operation t(A)%*%E.

B = read("DML/data/B"); #matrix(1,rows=10,cols=10) #
E = read("DML/data/E"); #matrix(1,rows=10,cols=10) #

F = t(A) + B 
G = t(A) %*% E

H = F + G
